golang/go,66626,type system,go/types: add iterator methods,"### Proposal Details

There are many data types in the API of go/types that expose a sequence through a pair of methods `NumFoo() int` and `Foo(int) Foo`. For each of them, we propose to define new convenience methods that are go1.23 push iterators:

```The provided code snippet defines several Go functions that act as iterators for various data structures. Each function takes a `yield` function as an argument and iterates over the elements of the respective data structure, calling `yield` on each element in order to perform some operation. The iterators are used to traverse interfaces, named types, scopes, structs, tuples, method sets, unions, type parameter lists, and type lists. Examples of usage are provided for each iterator.```

Fortunately, the most natural name (usually the plural) was available in all cases.

@findleyr @gri @mdempsky ",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, let me read through the issue details. The title is ""go/types: add iterator methods"". The body proposes adding several iterator methods to various types in the go/types package. These iterators are meant to simplify looping over sequences like methods, fields, etc., using Go 1.23's iterator support. The examples provided show how these new methods can replace manual loops with for-range statements.

Looking at the patches:

Patch 1 adds new method declarations using an iterator interface from the iter package. Each line represents a new method added to different structs like Interface, MethodSet, etc., each returning an iterator sequence of specific types.

Patch 2 is a documentation change, explaining how these new methods can simplify code by replacing manual indexing with iterators. It lists all the new methods and provides examples of their usage.

Patch 3 modifies existing code to use one of the new Methods() iterators instead of a manual loop, demonstrating the practical application of these changes.

Patch 4 is the actual implementation of all these iterator methods. Each function takes a yield function and iterates over the sequence using the existing Len() and At() methods, yielding each element until the yield returns false or the end is reached.

Now, considering the label ""type system"": The type system in Go refers to how types are defined, their structures, and operations allowed on them. The changes here add iterator methods to various type structs in the go/types package, which is part of Go's standard library for handling type information, especially in tools and analyses.

The new methods don't introduce new types or change existing type definitions but rather provide a more convenient way to iterate over collections associated with these types. This enhances the API around type information without altering the fundamental type system itself.

However, since these changes are within the go/types package, which is integral to Go's type system infrastructure, the label ""type system"" could be considered appropriate because it relates to how types and their related data structures are accessed and manipulated.

Alternatively, another possible label might be ""api change"" or ""feature enhancement,"" but given that the issue involves adding methods to structs in go/types, which is part of the type system, ""type system"" seems fitting.

Therefore, I conclude that the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the title and body of the issue.

The title is ""go/types: add iterator methods."" From this, it seems like the proposal is about adding some new methods related to iterators in the go/types package. The body goes into more detail with several code examples showing the addition of various iterator functions for different types such as Interface, Named, Scope, Struct, Tuple, MethodSet, Union, TypeParamList, and TypeList.

Looking at these examples, each method is an iterator that loops through elements like methods, explicit methods, embedded types, fields, variables, terms, type parameters, etc. These are all part of the Go programming language's type system because they deal with how different data structures and types are defined and interact in Go.

The label ""type system"" refers to the components and rules that define data types in a programming language. Since this issue is about adding iterator methods to various type-related structs (like Interface, Struct, etc.) within the go/types package, it directly relates to how these types are handled and accessed. Therefore, the changes proposed are part of enhancing or modifying the existing type system.

I don't see any mention of other areas like performance, bug fixes, or new features unrelated to types. All the proposed methods are about iterating over elements that are integral parts of Go's type definitions. So, using the ""type system"" label makes sense because it encapsulates all these changes related to how types and their components are accessed.

I don't think any other labels like ""feature request"" or ""enhancement"" would be more accurate here because while this is a new feature, it's specifically about the type system. Therefore, the assigned label correctly reflects the content of the issue.
</think>

The label ""type system"" accurately reflects the issue report as it pertains to adding iterator methods for various type-related structs in Go.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Have config/env option to disable all PT2 caching."" This clearly mentions caching, specifically about adding a configuration or environment option to turn off all PT2 caching. So the title is directly related to caching mechanisms.

Now, the body of the issue explains that they want to create a config or env option to disable PT2 caching. They also provided an internal reference link, but since I can't access it, I'll focus on what's here. The body doesn't add much beyond the title but reinforces that the feature is about controlling caching behavior.

Looking at the patches made:

Patch 1 adds a new configuration option called ""force_disable_caches"" to the inductor meta settings. This seems like it's adding the actual toggle they wanted.

Patch 2 modifies some functions to check this new config option. It wraps a function with a decorator that uses ""with_fresh_cache_if_config,"" which probably resets the cache when the option is enabled. So, this patch ensures that when the new option is set, caching is bypassed as intended.

Patch 3 introduces an environment variable ""TORCHINDUCTOR_FORCE_DISABLE_CACHES"" which sets the ""force_disable_caches"" flag. This allows users to enable or disable caching via an environment setting, aligning with the issue's request for a config/env option.

Patch 4 adjusts the logic in the autotune function so that it only attempts to load cached configurations if ""force_disable_caches"" is not set. This means that when caching is disabled, it skips loading from the cache, which makes sense as part of disabling all caching.

Putting this all together: The issue is about adding a way to disable caching, and all the patches are implementing this feature by adding config options, environment variables, and modifying the code to respect these settings. Therefore, the label ""cache"" perfectly encapsulates what the issue is addressing—modifying how caching behaves in the system.

I don't see any aspects of the issue or the patches that would fall outside the scope of caching. Everything here revolves around controlling and managing cache behavior.
</think>

The label ""cache"" accurately reflects the issue, which focuses on adding a configuration option to disable caching. All changes are related to caching mechanisms.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is ""Have config/env option to disable all PT2 caching."" At first glance, this seems related to caching because it mentions disabling caching. The word ""caching"" directly points towards issues or features related to cache mechanisms in the codebase.

Looking at the body of the issue, it starts with a feature pitch, mentioning an internal reference link which I can't access, but the main point is about creating a config or environment option to disable all PT2 caching. The user then lists several people to CC, which might indicate it's an internal issue with others being notified.

There are no alternatives provided, and the additional context section is empty. So, the primary content revolves around adding a configuration option to disable caching for PT2. 

The label assigned here is ""cache."" Since the entire discussion is about controlling caching behavior through configuration, this seems directly relevant. The feature request is specifically about managing or disabling the existing caching functionality.

I don't see any other aspects in the issue that would suggest different labels like performance, configuration, or feature-request being more appropriate. While those could be secondary labels, ""cache"" is definitely a primary and accurate label for this issue.

So, considering all parts of the title and body, the label ""cache"" fits well because the issue is about modifying caching behavior through a new configuration option.
</think>

The label ""cache"" accurately reflects the issue as it deals with disabling caching functionality.

php/php-src,13988,memory leak,Storing DOMElement consume 4 times more memory in PHP 8.1 than in PHP 8.0,"### Description

My application uses `DOMElement` to work on large XML files and manipulates them extensively. I observed a significant increase in peak memory usage between PHP 8.0 and PHP 8.1 while running the same code base, despite performing the same number of operations (200k `DOMElement::setAttribute` calls).

Peak memory usage increased from 30MB in PHP 8.0 to 100MB in PHP 8.1, despite similar operations being performed.
The issue persists across multiple PHP minor versions from PHP 7.4.33 to PHP 8.3.6.

I attempted to reproduce the issue in a minimal code snippet and observed that stored `DOMElement` objects consume increasingly more memory with each PHP version.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""memory leak"" correctly reflects the given issue report. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The issue has a title and body, but they aren't shown here. However, there are patches provided in the context, labeled as Patch 6 and Patch 7, along with some test cases. The patches seem to modify PHP files related to DOMDocument and XPath classes.

Looking at the code changes, I see that several properties in these classes have been marked as @virtual. For example, in the DOMText class, the ""wholeText"" property is made virtual. Similarly, in other classes like DocumentFragment, various properties are being set to virtual.

In PHP, when a property is declared with the @virtual annotation, it typically means that it's being overridden or extended in a child class. This can sometimes relate to how objects handle their state and memory, especially if these properties were previously causing issues with serialization or memory management.

The test cases provided in Patch 6 and 7 show var_dump outputs of DOMText and DOMElement objects. The key change is that the object hashes are now represented with %d instead of fixed numbers (like #7). This suggests that each instance's hash might be unique, which can help prevent issues where multiple instances share the same identifier, potentially leading to memory leaks if not handled correctly.

Additionally, in Patch 6 and 7, certain properties like ""schemaTypeInfo"" are either added or made optional. These changes could be addressing how objects retain their data, ensuring that unnecessary references aren't held longer than needed, which is a common cause of memory leaks.

Putting this together, the patches seem to address issues where DOMDocument objects might not have been garbage collected properly due to incorrect handling of their properties. By making certain properties virtual and adjusting object identification in dumps, it likely fixes scenarios where objects were retaining memory longer than necessary, thus preventing memory leaks.

Therefore, yes, the label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects this issue because the changes are aimed at correcting how objects manage their state and prevent unnecessary memory retention.
</think>

The patches address issues related to DOMDocument object properties and serialization, which can cause memory leaks. The changes aim to fix these by correctly handling virtual properties and object identification.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the title of the issue is about storing DOMElement consuming four times more memory in PHP 8.1 compared to PHP 8.0. That immediately points towards a memory-related problem, but I need to see if it's a leak or just increased usage.

Looking at the body, the user mentions that their application uses DOMElement to handle large XML files and performs a lot of setAttribute operations—200k of them. They noticed that the peak memory usage jumped from 30MB in PHP 8.0 to 100MB in PHP 8.1 while doing the same tasks.

They also tested this across multiple versions, from 7.4.33 up to 8.3.6, and provided a table showing memory usage. The results show that starting from PHP 8.1 upwards, memory usage is higher. For example, with 25k DOMElements, it's 16MB in 8.3, 14MB in 8.1-8.2, and only 4MB in earlier versions.

The user expected the memory to stay consistent but instead saw a significant increase. Now, the key here is whether this is a leak or just higher consumption. A memory leak usually means that memory isn't being freed properly after use, leading to increasing usage over time as the program runs. In this case, the issue seems to be that each DOMElement object takes up more memory in newer PHP versions, not necessarily that the memory is leaking.

The minimal code snippet they provided shows a consistent increase with each version, but it's a one-time measurement, not showing that memory keeps growing over time beyond what's expected. So it looks more like an increased memory footprint rather than a leak where used memory isn't being released.

Therefore, while the issue is definitely about higher memory usage, labeling it as a ""memory leak"" might be incorrect because there's no indication of memory not being freed after operations. It's more about inefficient memory usage in newer PHP versions.
</think>

The label ""memory leak"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue since the problem is increased memory consumption rather than memory not being freed.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""cmd/link: runtime.mach_vm_region_trampoline: unsupported dynamic relocation for symbol libc_mach_task_self_ (type=29 (R_GOTPCREL) stype=46 (SDYNIMPORT))"". This seems to be a linker error related to a dynamic relocation. The mention of R_GOTPCREL and SDYNIMPORT suggests it's about how symbols are being handled during linking, possibly in a dynamic context.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. The user is trying to compile a plugin using Go. They mention that when they include a specific import (""myprog/model""), the build fails with the error shown in the title. Without that import, it works fine. It's also noted that this happens on macOS (darwin/amd64), but not on other platforms like Linux or ARM-based macOS.

The user provided the Go version and environment details, which helps identify the context but doesn't directly point to the cause. The key part is the build command using -buildmode=plugin, which clearly indicates they're building a Go plugin.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

1. Patch 1 adds a test case named TestIssue67976, which specifically tests building a plugin using runtime/pprof on darwin/amd64. This suggests that the problem was related to plugins and dynamic imports in the build process for macOS AMD64 systems.

2. Patch 2 creates a new file with a minimal example that reproduces the issue. It uses the runtime/pprof package, which is known to involve certain dynamic imports or profiling features that might trigger linker issues when building plugins.

3. Patch 3 modifies the linker's handling of R_GOTPCREL relocations. This change seems to allow external linking for such relocations in specific build modes (plugin or shared), which aligns with the problem the user encountered while building a plugin.

Putting it all together, the issue revolves around building a Go plugin on macOS AMD64, where including certain imports causes a linker error due to unsupported dynamic relocations. The patches address this by adjusting how the linker handles these specific relocation types in plugin build modes.

The label assigned was ""plugin"". Considering that the problem occurs specifically when building a plugin and the patches are related to plugin build handling, this label seems appropriate. It accurately captures the context of the issue being tied to Go's plugin functionality.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The issue's title mentions an error related to a dynamic relocation when compiling a Go plugin. The body provides more details: the user is trying to build a plugin using `go build -buildmode=plugin` and encountering a specific runtime error. They also mention that this happens on macOS (Darwin) when importing certain modules, while it works fine on ARM64 Darwin and Linux.

The label assigned here is ""plugin."" I need to assess if that's appropriate. The issue revolves around building a plugin in Go, so the problem is directly related to plugin compilation. The error seems specific to how plugins are handled during the build process, especially when importing shared code from the main module.

Looking at the environment details and commands used, everything points towards plugin-related issues. The user's steps involve creating a plugin with `-buildmode=plugin`, which clearly indicates they're dealing with Go's plugin system.

So, considering all this, the label ""plugin"" does accurately reflect the issue because it's about problems arising when compiling a Go plugin.

Additionally, the Svelte package version is 5.0.0-next.243.```


### Severity

annoyance",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Svelte 5: `$host()` assignment statement will be removed after compilation"". The title suggests that when someone uses `$host()` and assigns it to a variable, that line of code disappears after compiling. That definitely sounds like unexpected behavior, which is typically considered a bug.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. It describes how assigning `$host()` to a variable results in the assignment statement being removed during compilation. The user provided a reproduction case with code examples. In their example, the compiled JavaScript is missing the `var element = $$props.$$host` line, which means the variable isn't being assigned as intended. This leads to issues because the rest of the code relies on that variable.

They also included system info showing they're using Svelte 5.0.0-next.243, so it's related to a specific version, which is relevant for bug tracking.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a fix message about ensuring `$host` rune compiles correctly in variable declarations. That implies that the issue was fixed by modifying how Svelte handles `$host()` when it's assigned to variables.

Patches 2 and 4 show changes in the code where `$host` is added to lists of runes, likely ensuring they're treated properly during compilation. This prevents their removal.

Patch 3 updates a test case, adding more buttons and events, which suggests testing the fix thoroughly.

All these patches are directly addressing the issue described: the incorrect removal of `$host()` assignments. They ensure that variable declarations using `$host()` aren't dropped during compilation, thus fixing the bug.

Since the problem was an unintended behavior in the code compilation process, and it's been addressed with specific fixes, labeling this as a ""bug"" is accurate. It wasn't a feature request or anything else—it was a clear issue causing incorrect functionality.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it describes unexpected behavior fixed by patches.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me read through the provided information carefully.

The issue's title is: ""Svelte 5: $host() assignment statement will be removed after compilation."" That sounds like a problem where something isn't behaving as expected when using Svelte, specifically with the `$host()` function in version 5.

Looking at the body, the user describes a bug where assigning `$host()` to a variable results in the assignment being removed during compilation. They provided a reproduction link and some code examples. The TypeScript code shows that `const element = $host() as HTMLElement;` is present, but after compilation, this line is missing, leading to issues because `element` isn't defined. 

In their system info, they're using Svelte 5.0.0-next.243, which is a development version, so it's plausible that there could be bugs in the compiler. The user also mentions the severity as ""annoyance,"" but that might not directly affect the label.

The label given is ""bug."" Since the issue describes unexpected behavior during compilation—specifically, code being omitted when it shouldn't be—it fits the definition of a bug. Bugs are typically issues where the software doesn't work as intended, which seems to be the case here because the variable assignment isn't retained after compilation.

I don't see any information that suggests this is a feature request or something else. The user is clearly pointing out an unintended behavior in the compiler's output.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue described. The problem involves unexpected behavior during compilation where code is omitted, which fits the definition of a bug.

These observations highlight potential issues with the GC configuration and thread management in the Julia environment.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the issue described in the provided context. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue isn't directly provided, but the patches and the problem they address suggest it's related to garbage collection (GC) and thread safety. The patches modify various parts of the code related to GC states, atomic operations, and thread management.

The body of the issue includes multiple patches that change how the GC state is managed. For example, in Patch 2, a new constant JL_GC_STATE_UNSAFE is defined, replacing the previous 0 value. This indicates a refactoring of how GC safety is tracked across threads. Other patches adjust where and when this state is set or checked, such as in functions related to thread initialization, suspension, and task management.

The problem seems to be about ensuring that threads correctly transition between safe and unsafe states during GC operations. If these transitions aren't handled properly, it could lead to race conditions or inconsistent states, which might cause crashes when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization.

Looking at the patches more closely:

1. Patch 2 defines JL_GC_STATE_UNSAFE as 0 and updates functions that set or check the GC state.
2. Patches 4 and 5 adjust assertions and function calls to use this new constant, ensuring consistency.
3. Patches 6 and 7 change initializations of thread TLS (Thread-Local Storage) to use the new state constant.

These changes prevent scenarios where a thread might incorrectly be considered safe when it's actually in an unsafe state, which could lead to concurrent modification issues and subsequent crashes. The modifications ensure that all parts of the code correctly handle GC states, thus preventing potential crashes due to race conditions or improper state management.

Since the patches address issues related to thread safety during GC, which if not fixed could cause the program to crash, the label ""crash"" is appropriate. It reflects the problem's nature accurately because incorrect GC state handling can lead to runtime errors and application crashes.
</think>

The patches address potential race conditions in garbage collection and thread safety that could lead to crashes. The label ""crash"" accurately reflects these issues.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""frequent segfault in threads tests in GC."" A segfault is a segmentation fault, which typically indicates a crash because the program tries to access memory it shouldn't. So the title suggests that there are frequent crashes during testing related to multithreading in the garbage collector (GC).

Now, examining the body of the issue. It describes that the GC is frequently causing segfaults, as seen in a core dump. The user provided a backtrace from GDB showing where the crash occurred—specifically in the `gc_should_mark` function at line 3111 of gc.c. They also included various debug outputs, such as thread counts and states. 

The key points are:
- Segfault happens when accessing `gc_all_tls_states[tid]`.
- The GC-worker thread is trying to access the GC state after it has already exited on the master thread.
- This results in unpredictable segfaults due to TSAN violations.

A segfault usually causes a program to crash, especially if it's not caught. Since this issue is about frequent crashes during tests, the label ""crash"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to the problem described—segfaulting leading to crashes.
</think>

The label ""crash"" accurately reflects the issue report as it involves segfaults causing program crashes.

Ideally, the `superhtml` file type would be added using the `.shtml` file extension as described [here](<URL> by the creator of superhtml and then the `ziggy` file type would be added using the `.ziggy` and `.ziggy-schema` file extensions as described [here](<URL>

**Additional context**
As these are simple changes, I am willing to do the leg work of the changes (though I am unfamiliar with vimscript atm). However, since `.shtml` is currently mapped and this is my first time being involved with the project I wanted to open an issue for discussion.
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""extension"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, let's look at the issue title: ""Add superhtml and ziggy filetype."" This suggests that the user is requesting support for new file types in Neovim. The body explains that they're working on adding these filetypes and want to use specific extensions (.shtml, .ziggy, .ziggy-schema). They mention being willing to do the work but are opening the issue for discussion.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds autocommands for *.ziggy and *.ziggy-schema, setting their filetypes to ziggy and ziggy_schema respectively. It also comments about adding these file types.

Patch 2 updates a dictionary that maps filetypes to their respective filename checks. It includes entries for ziggy and ziggy_schema with their corresponding file extensions.

Patch 3 seems to include the patch number in an array, indicating it's part of the changes made.

The label assigned is ""extension."" I'm trying to think about what this label typically represents. Often, ""extension"" refers to adding new features or functionalities beyond the core product, like extending Neovim with support for new filetypes.

In this case, the issue is about adding support for superhtml and ziggy filetypes by recognizing their extensions. This fits well under an ""extension"" label because it's expanding Neovim's capabilities to handle more file types, which is a form of extending its functionality.

I don't see any information suggesting that the changes are bug fixes or related to other labels like ""bug,"" ""enhancement,"" or ""discussion."" The focus is on adding new supported extensions, so ""extension"" seems appropriate.
</think>

The label ""extension"" accurately reflects the issue as it's about adding support for new filetypes through their extensions. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""extension"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the title and body of the issue carefully.

The title is ""Add superhtml and ziggy filetype"". That makes it clear that the user wants to add support for two new file types in Neovim: superhtml and ziggy. 

Looking at the body, the user explains that they're working on adding these to the Neovim ecosystem. They mention needing to add file type support using specific extensions—`.shtml` for superhtml and `.ziggy` or `.ziggy-schema` for ziggy. The user also notes that while they're willing to do the work, they opened the issue for discussion because they're new to the project.

Now, the label assigned is ""extension"". I'm trying to understand what that means in this context. In software projects, especially related to text editors like Neovim, an ""extension"" usually refers to a plugin or add-on that extends functionality. Adding support for new file types might fall under that category because it's enhancing the editor's capabilities.

But wait, is there a more specific label that would better fit this request? For instance, something like ""filetype-support"" or ""new-feature"". However, considering common labeling practices on GitHub, ""extension"" seems appropriate here. The user is essentially asking to extend Neovim by adding new filetype recognitions, which fits the idea of an extension.

I don't see any mention of bugs or breaking changes, so labels like ""bug"" or ""breaking-change"" wouldn't apply. The issue is purely about adding a new feature, which aligns with the ""extension"" label as it's about extending functionality rather than fixing something.

Therefore, after analyzing both the title and body, I agree that ""extension"" accurately reflects the intent of this issue report.

rust-lang/rust,122476,concurrency,Compiling std atomic with thread sanitizer causes broken LLVM emission.,"

Update: I forgot to write the command, its

```This code snippet runs a Rust test with thread sanitization using Cargo. It sets the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable to enable thread sanitization and specifies the nightly Rust toolchain, targeting `aarch64-apple-darwin`. The `""$@""` passes additional arguments to the command.```
I tried this code:

```This Rust code snippet defines a `main` function that prints ""Hello, world!"" to the console. It imports `AtomicUsize` from the `core::sync::atomic` module but does not use it.```

I expected to see this happen: compiles fine

Instead, this happened: I get an `rustc-LLVM ERROR: Broken function found, compilation aborted!`.

This does not occur on `nightly-2024-03-12`.

### Meta


`rustc --version --verbose`:
```The log indicates that the Rust compiler version is 1.78.0-nightly, built on March 13, 2024, with commit hash 3cbb93223f33024db464a4df27a13c7cce870173, and is running on an aarch64-apple-darwin host. The LLVM version used is 18.1.0.```

```````The log shows the compilation process using Rust's nightly toolchain targeting aarch64-apple-darwin. It compiles several standard Rust libraries and a test module. The compilation aborts due to errors encountered while processing functions related to atomic operations. Specifically, there are issues with `zext` instructions being applied to non-integer types, leading to a ""Broken function found"" error from rustc-LLVM, which causes the compilation to terminate. Two different atomic swap functions are identified as problematic: `_ZN4core4sync6atomic11atomic_swap17hd7a3400f2ad7716aE` and `_ZN4core4sync6atomic11atomic_swap17h83c92551d8fdbc7aE`.```

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the issue report carefully. The title says that compiling std::atomic with thread sanitizer causes broken LLVM emission. So right away, it's about using atomic operations and the thread sanitizer causing a problem.

Looking at the body, the user provided a command they ran which includes RUSTFLAGS for the thread sanitizer. They tried a simple Rust program using AtomicUsize and encountered an error during compilation. The error message mentions ""Broken function found"" in functions related to atomic_swap. 

The backtrace shows multiple instances of ""ZExt only operates on integer"", pointing to specific lines where pointer %1 is being extended to i64. It seems like the compiler is trying to perform a zero extension operation on a pointer, which isn't valid because ZExt expects an integer type.

Now, looking at the patch that fixed this issue. The patch updates a subproject commit in the LLVM project. Specifically, it changes the commit from 84f190a4 to 0af6c732ec. I need to figure out what this change does. Since I can't look up the actual commits, I have to infer based on context.

The issue is happening when using the thread sanitizer and atomic operations. Thread sanitizers are tools that detect data races in concurrent programs. Atomic operations are a fundamental part of concurrency to prevent such races. The error occurs during compilation, specifically when emitting LLVM code for these atomic functions. 

So, this bug seems related to how the compiler handles atomic operations under the thread sanitizer. The fix is likely an adjustment in the way atomic primitives are compiled into LLVM IR, preventing invalid ZExt operations on pointers.

The label ""concurrency"" fits here because it's about issues arising from using concurrent programming constructs (atomics) with a tool meant for concurrency debugging (thread sanitizer). Even though the error is during compilation, the root cause ties back to concurrency-related features and tools.

Therefore, assigning the ""concurrency"" label accurately reflects the nature of this issue. It's not just a general compiler bug but specifically related to how concurrent code is handled.
</think>

The issue revolves around problems with atomic operations when using the thread sanitizer, which are both elements of concurrent programming. The fix addresses how these operations are compiled into LLVM IR, confirming that the label ""concurrency"" accurately captures the problem's context.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the title: ""Compiling std atomic with thread sanitizer causes broken LLVM emission."" The key words here are ""std atomic,"" which relates to atomic operations in Rust, and ""thread sanitizer,"" which is a tool used to detect concurrency issues like data races. So right off the bat, this seems related to concurrency because it's about threading and atomic operations.

Looking at the body, the user provided a command they ran that includes a thread sanitizer with RUSTFLAGS set to ""-Z sanitizer=thread."" They tried compiling some Rust code that uses `core::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize`, which is definitely part of concurrent programming in Rust. The expected outcome was that it compiles fine, but instead, there's an error related to broken LLVM emission.

The backtrace shows multiple errors with ""ZExt only operates on integer,"" which seems like an LLVM-level issue. These errors occurred during the compilation of `std` and `test` libraries when using the thread sanitizer. The functions involved are named things like `_ZN4core4sync6atomic11atomic_swap...`, which clearly relate to atomic operations, a fundamental part of concurrency.

So, putting this together: the problem arises when using the thread sanitizer, which is specifically for detecting concurrency bugs, and it's happening in code that uses atomic types. The error is during compilation with these settings, indicating an issue with how the compiler handles atomic operations under the thread sanitizer.

The label ""concurrency"" seems to fit because the issue revolves around threading, sanitizers checking thread behavior, and atomic operations—all of which are core aspects of concurrent programming. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content of the report.
</think>

The label ""concurrency"" is appropriate as the issue involves the thread sanitizer detecting issues in code using atomic operations, which are central to concurrency.

Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let me read through the title and body of the issue. The title says: ""Next in Vercel - SSG page with fetch `cache: no-store` responds with `404 Not Found` page."" So, it seems like when a user deploys to Vercel, their server-side generated (SSG) page isn't working as expected. Specifically, when using `cache: no-store`, the page returns a 404 error instead of rendering correctly.

Looking at the body, the user provided steps to reproduce. They have a sample code that works locally but fails on Vercel. The issue arises during deployment, leading to a 404 Not Found error. This suggests that something about the way Vercel handles caching or routing for SSG pages is causing the problem.

The environment information includes details like Node version, Next.js version (14.1.0), and other relevant packages. It also mentions that the areas affected are App Router and Data fetching (which relates to SSG/SSP). The stages affected are specifically during deployment on Vercel.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 talks about fixing a missing app route with mixed SSR/SSG dynamic routes. This indicates that the issue might be related to how Next.js handles different rendering strategies (like mixing Server-Side Rendering and Static Generation) for certain routes.

Patch 2 modifies serverBuild function by adding checks before pruning prerendered routes, specifically when dealing with app routes in the manifest. This suggests it's about ensuring that dynamic routes which mix SSG and SSR are handled correctly during build time to prevent incorrect route pruning.

Patches 3 adds a page with generateStaticParams, which seems to create static paths for some slugs but bails to server-side rendering (SSR) for 'third'. This might be testing how Next.js handles mixed static and SSR content within the same dynamic route.

Patch 4 updates probes to check if certain paths return 200 with expected content. This is likely adding tests to ensure that after the fix, all these routes work as intended.

Patch 5 increases the expected number of lambdas from 5 to 7. Since Vercel uses serverless functions (lambdas) for Next.js deployments, this change might be ensuring that the correct number of lambda functions are generated when mixing SSR and SSG, preventing some lambdas from being mistakenly pruned.

Putting it all together, the issue seems related to how Next.js on Vercel handles mixed rendering strategies (SSG and SSR) within dynamic routes. The problem arises during deployment where certain pages return 404 instead of rendering correctly because of incorrect pruning or handling of app routes that mix these strategies.

The label assigned is ""cache"". But from what I understand, the issue isn't directly about caching in terms of how data is fetched (like using `getStaticProps` with a cache) but more about how Next.js and Vercel handle different rendering methods for dynamic routes during deployment. The use of `cache: no-store` in the fetch might be part of the problem, but the core issue seems to revolve around route handling and deployment rather than caching mechanisms.

Therefore, labeling it as ""cache"" doesn't capture the essence of the problem, which is more about routing and rendering strategies in a serverless environment. A better label might be something like ""routing"" or ""deployment"" since those are the areas where the issue manifests.
</think>

The label assigned was ""cache,"" but upon analysis, the core issue relates to routing and deployment handling rather than caching mechanisms.

0",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me read through the problem again.

The title is: ""Next in Vercel - SSG page with fetch `cache: no-store` responds with `404 Not Found` page."" So it mentions a Vercel deployment issue where an SSG (Static Site Generation) page using a fetch request with cache set to no-store results in a 404 error. 

Looking at the body, the user provided steps to reproduce, mentioning that locally everything works fine, but when deployed to Vercel, accessing the same endpoint gives a 404 instead of rendering the page. They also provided their environment details and specified that the areas affected are App Router and Data fetching (related to getStaticProps or similar methods). 

The key point here is the mention of `cache: no-store` in the fetch request. The issue seems to relate to how Vercel handles caching for static pages, especially when certain cache directives are set. In this case, using `no-store` might be causing Vercel's edge network or CDN to not cache the response properly, leading to a 404 error because perhaps the page isn't being served correctly.

The label assigned was ""cache,"" which directly relates to how the fetch request is handling caching and how Vercel processes these requests. The problem revolves around the caching behavior affecting the deployment outcome, so it's appropriate to tag this issue with ""cache"" as it highlights that the caching mechanism is a key part of the problem.

Therefore, I think the label accurately reflects the issue described.

rust-lang/rust,124685,bug,False positives from invalid_reference_casting,"```The code snippet defines a Rust function `apply_mask` that takes a mutable reference to a slice of `u8` bytes, an `usize` offset, and a `u64` mask. It applies the bitwise OR operation between the 8 bytes starting at the given offset and the provided mask. The function ensures the offset plus eight does not exceed the array length before performing the operation. It uses pointer arithmetic and `unsafe` block to perform the bitwise operation on the underlying `u64` value.```

Starting with rustc 1.78.0 (because of #118983) this produces the following

Perhaps I'm missing something but this is not undefined behavior as far as I can tell. The lint is wrong about the backing allocation and I suspect the false warning is downstream from that?",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""False positives from invalid_reference_casting"". This suggests that the reporter is encountering a situation where the Rust compiler is incorrectly flagging some code as having undefined behavior when it's actually not. So, they're getting false positive warnings or errors from the tool.

The body of the issue provides a Rust code snippet that triggers this problem. The user writes a function that manipulates an array using pointers and casts. They mention that starting with rustc 1.78.0 (due to another issue #118983), the compiler produces an error about undefined behavior related to casting references to a bigger memory layout than the backing allocation.

The user argues that this isn't actually undefined behavior, implying that the compiler's warning is incorrect. They suspect the false warning might be due to a mistake in how the lint determines the backing allocation.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies the `is_cast_to_bigger_memory_layout` function. It adds a check for expressions of kind `ExprKind::Index`, and if so, returns None. This means that when dealing with indexed expressions (like array accesses), the code won't attempt to determine the allocation, thus avoiding the false positive.

Patch 2 seems to add a test case. The unsafe function `slice_index` is created within the `bigger_layout()` module, which includes similar code to what the user reported: taking a slice, indexing it, and casting pointers to u64. This serves as a regression test to ensure that the issue doesn't resurface after the fix.

So, the patches are fixing the compiler's handling of indexed expressions in reference casts. The original problem was a false positive where the compiler incorrectly flagged valid code as having undefined behavior because it couldn't correctly trace the allocation when using array indexing.

The label assigned is ""bug"". I think this makes sense because the issue is about incorrect compiler behavior (a bug) causing false positives, and the patches fix that by adjusting how the backing allocation is determined in such cases. So, yes, the label accurately reflects the problem.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The user provided a Rust code snippet that's causing an error starting from rustc version 1.78.0. The issue seems to be related to invalid_reference_casting, which is a lint that's denied by default. 

Looking at the code, they're taking a reference to a u8 array element and then casting it through raw pointers to treat it as a u64 pointer. They're using unsafe code with write_unaligned and read_unaligned. The compiler is flagging this as undefined behavior because it thinks the backing allocation isn't sufficient for a u64.

The user argues that this isn't undefined behavior and believes the lint might be giving a false warning. So they think there's a bug in the compiler or the lint system.

Now, considering the label ""bug"" – this is typically used when there's an issue with the tool itself (like the Rust compiler here) where it doesn't behave as expected or according to specifications. Since the user is pointing out that their code should be valid but the compiler is incorrectly flagging it, that suggests a problem with the tool rather than their own code.

So yes, labeling this as a bug makes sense because they're reporting an issue in Rustc's handling of reference casting and undefined behavior detection.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it concerns unexpected behavior from the Rust compiler, indicating a possible flaw in its lint system or error reporting.

Alright, let's break down whether the label ""missing"" is accurate for this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the title: it says there's missing version info for `TextEncoder.prototype.encodeInto()`. That suggests that some information wasn't included where it should be, so the label seems to fit here.

Next, the body of the issue explains that the method was shipped in v12.11.0 but wasn't documented properly. It also mentions a version mismatch with `TextDecoder` and points out incorrect documentation. This reinforces that something (version info) is indeed missing or incorrect in the documentation.

Now, looking at the patches applied. The first patch adds a YAML comment specifying `added: v12.11.0`. This directly addresses the missing version information by adding it where it was lacking. So the fix confirms that the issue was about missing data.

Putting it all together: the title points out missing info, the body details what's wrong with the documentation, and the patch adds the missing version. The label ""missing"" encapsulates all these aspects accurately.
</think>

The label ""missing"" correctly reflects the issue as it addresses the absence of version information in the documentation.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""missing"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue report provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""doc: Missing version info for `TextEncoder.prototype.encodeInto()`"". The word ""Missing"" here clearly indicates that something is absent in the documentation. That seems to align with the label ""missing"".

Now, diving into the body of the issue. The user provides URLs where the problem exists, specifically pointing out that the method `TextEncoder.prototype.encodeInto()` was introduced in v12.11.0 but isn't documented. They also mention a version mismatch for `TextDecoder`, noting that the information is incorrectly placed under the constructor instead of the interface.

They reference specific pull requests and release notes to support their claim, which adds credibility to their assertion. The user is pointing out that certain version details are either missing or misplaced in the documentation. This further supports the idea that the issue is about something being absent or incorrect in the docs.

The label ""missing"" in this context would typically be used when a feature, information, or functionality isn't present where it should be. Since the user is highlighting that version information for certain methods isn't correctly documented, the label fits because it's pointing out missing content in the documentation.

There's no mention of other issues like bugs in the code or performance problems, so labels like ""bug"" or ""performance"" wouldn't apply here. It's strictly about missing documentation, which matches the ""missing"" label.

I don't see any conflicting information that would suggest another label is more appropriate. The focus is entirely on the absence of version details in the documentation for specific methods.
</think>

The label ""missing"" accurately reflects the issue as it concerns absent version information in the documentation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""non local definitions"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Unbound local in inductor with inplace foreach and views."" This suggests that there's an unbound local variable somewhere in the code related to the inductor when using inplace foreach operations with multiple views. Unbound locals usually mean a variable is referenced before it's assigned, which can cause errors.

Next, the body of the issue provides more context. It mentions that calling an inplace foreach op with multiple views in the first input list causes Inductor to generate bad code. There's also a link to a gist, but I can't access it, so I'll focus on what's provided here. The versions and people mentioned aren't directly relevant to the label assessment.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue. Patch 1 adds a test case for aliasing in the foreach_add function. It creates several inputs with views and checks if the compiled code matches the eager execution. This suggests they're ensuring that when multiple views (which are different tensors but share data) are used in foreach operations, the generated code doesn't have issues.

Patch 2 seems to modify functions related to pruning redundant dependencies in fused nodes. It introduces a new function _prune_redundant_deps and updates prune_redundant_deps methods in FusedSchedulerNode and SchedulerNode classes. The comments mention weak dependencies and ensuring fusions happen in the correct order, which relates to how nodes are managed during fusion.

The original label assigned is ""non local definitions."" But looking at the patches, especially Patch 2, it's about managing dependencies between nodes during fusion. It seems the problem was that certain dependencies were being kept when they should have been pruned, leading to incorrect ordering or references. This might cause variables to be referenced incorrectly, hence the unbound local error mentioned in the title.

However, ""non local definitions"" usually refers to using variables outside their scope without proper declaration. The issue here seems more about dependency management and correct variable scoping during code generation in Inductor. So while the symptoms (unbound locals) might relate to variable usage, the root cause is about how dependencies are handled after fusing nodes.

Therefore, the label ""non local definitions"" doesn't accurately capture the essence of the problem because it's more about dependency pruning and fusion order rather than non-local variables.
</think>

The patches address issues with dependency management during node fusion, not non-local variable usage. The unbound local error was a symptom of incorrect dependencies.

0",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""non local definitions"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll look at the title: ""Unbound local in inductor with inplace foreach and views."" So it mentions an ""unbound local,"" which suggests there's a variable that's being referenced but not properly defined or scoped.

The body describes a bug where using an inplace foreach op with multiple views on the first input list causes Inductor to generate bad code. The user provided a link, but since I can't access external links, I'll focus on the text given. They also tagged several people, which is more about notification than the issue itself.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""non local definitions."" That term usually refers to variables that are not declared within a function but are used in it. In Python, for example, using a variable inside a function that's defined outside without declaring it as nonlocal can cause issues.

In this case, the title mentions an unbound local, which is a specific type of error related to variable scoping. The bug seems to occur under certain conditions with inplace foreach operations and views. So, the problem is likely about how variables are being handled in the code generation, possibly leading to an UnboundLocalError.

The label ""non local definitions"" seems relevant because it's about how variables are scoped and whether they're correctly defined within their intended scope. If Inductor isn't handling these variables properly when generating code, especially with inplace operations and views, this could result in non-local definitions being mismanaged, leading to unbound locals.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue described because it's about variable scoping and definitions, which aligns with the problem of an unbound local variable.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40313,runtime error,Loading of custom deny-all filter can cause a StackOverflowError when deploying to Tomcat with Log4j2 configured to use a single JVM-wide logger context,Forward port of issue #40312 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

So, looking at the title: it mentions a StackOverflowError when deploying to Tomcat with Log4j2 configured in a certain way. StackOverflowError is definitely a runtime issue because it happens during execution, not at compile time or build time.

The body of the issue says it's a forward port of another issue, which suggests that this problem was already identified and addressed in a previous version and now needs to be fixed again in the 3.3.x branch. That doesn't add much new info but confirms it's about an existing bug.

Now looking at the patches provided: The changes replace a custom anonymous Filter implementation with DenyAllFilter.newBuilder().build();. This suggests that there was some problem with the original filter causing a StackOverflowError, perhaps due to infinite recursion or excessive resource usage. By switching to a built-in filter, they might be avoiding that issue.

So the problem is about an error occurring when the application runs (deploying to Tomcat), which fits the definition of a runtime error. The label ""runtime error"" accurately captures this because it's an exception that occurs during execution, not something related to build issues, configuration errors, or other types of problems.

I don't see any indication that this is, say, a bug in the codebase (which could be labeled as ""bug"") but more specifically about an error happening at runtime. So yes, the label seems appropriate.
</think>

The issue describes a StackOverflowError during deployment, which occurs at runtime. The patches address this by replacing problematic code with a built-in solution to prevent such errors. Thus, the label accurately reflects a runtime error.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""Loading of custom deny-all filter can cause a StackOverflowError when deploying to Tomcat with Log4j2 configured to use a single JVM-wide logger context."" The key terms here are ""StackOverflowError"" which is a type of runtime error. It occurs during execution when a program attempts to use more memory for the call stack than is available, causing the thread of execution to crash.

Next, the body says: ""Forward port of issue #40312 to 3.3.x."" This indicates that it's a known issue being moved to another branch, but doesn't add much detail beyond what's in the title.

So, the main point is the StackOverflowError, which is indeed a runtime error because it happens when the program runs and tries to load the custom filter in Tomcat. The label ""runtime error"" seems appropriate here since it directly relates to an error occurring during execution.

golang/go,66215,bug,os: winsymlink and winreadlinkvolume missing IncNonDefault calls,"The new definitions of winsymlink and winreadlinkvolume godebugs in package os are missing calls to IncNonDefault to record when they change the behavior of the program. See `go doc internal/godebug` for details. 

Note that to be a useful metric, IncNonDefault has to be called _only_ when the result is actually different, not just when new code is executing that does the same thing old code would have done for a given input. That means checking the input and understanding when a deviation is happening.

This means that

	if winsymlink.Value() == ""0"" {
		return fs.modePreGo1_23()
	}

is not a viable implementation strategy on its own. However, one possibility is to rename the current Mode to mode and then do

	func (fs *fileStat) Mode() FileMode {
		m := fs.mode()
		if winsymlink.Value() == ""0"" {
			old := fs.modePreGo1_23()
			if old != m {
				winsymlink.IncNonDefault()
				m = old

Alright, let's break down whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report.

First, looking at the issue title: ""os: winsymlink and winreadlinkvolume missing IncNonDefault calls."" This suggests that certain functions aren't calling a necessary method related to debugging metrics. The body explains that without these calls, the program can't accurately track when behaviors deviate from defaults, which is important for monitoring non-default executions.

The patches provided show several changes. Patch 1 modifies the visibility of the flags by removing ""Opaque: true,"" making them visible in the metrics. Patches 2 and 3 introduce IncNonDefault calls where they were missing. Specifically, after checking if the value is not default, these functions now increment the non-default behavior counters. Additionally, new documentation entries are added in Patch 4 to describe these metrics.

Considering all this, the issue was about a missing functionality (IncNonDefault calls) which led to incorrect tracking of non-default behaviors. The changes fix this omission, which implies that the original code had a bug—specifically, not correctly implementing required functionality for debugging purposes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it addresses missing functionality leading to incorrect behavior.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

Looking at the title: ""os: winsymlink and winreadlinkvolume missing IncNonDefault calls"". This suggests that certain functions in the os package are not calling IncNonDefault when they should be. 

In the body, the user explains that these new definitions are missing calls to IncNonDefault, which is part of the godebugs package. They mention that this function records when the program's behavior changes. The note clarifies that IncNonDefault must be called only when the result differs, not just when new code runs.

The provided example shows how Mode() could be implemented incorrectly and suggests a possible correct approach using modePreGo1_23(), checking if the old value is different before calling IncNonDefault. They also mention renaming current Mode to mode.

So, this isn't just a suggestion or feature request; it's pointing out missing functionality that affects how program behavior is tracked. The absence of these calls could lead to incorrect metrics, which would be considered a bug because it's a deviation from expected behavior.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" fits because it's about an unintended omission causing incorrect functionality.
</think>

The issue report describes a specific problem where certain functions are missing necessary calls, leading to incorrect behavior. This is a clear bug as it involves unintended deviations affecting functionality.

pytorch/pytorch,140014,runtime error,[fx] split_module fails with no-op graph and keep_original_order=True,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

`````The code imports necessary modules from PyTorch and defines a function `fn`. It then uses `make_fx` to create a trace of `fn` with fake tracing and prints the readable graph. The comment indicates that setting `keep_original_order=False` works, but doing so with `keep_original_order=True` causes an error when using `split_module` with a split callback.```

Error
```The log shows a `KeyError: 'x_1'` occurring during the execution of the `split_module` function from the PyTorch FX library. The error arises when attempting to access a node named `'x_1'` in the environment dictionary `base_mod_env`.```

Following patch seems to do the trick (do this seem like a good fix?)
```The code snippet shows a diff for the `split_module.py` file in the `torch/fx/passes` directory. It adds a conditional block that checks if `keep_original_order` is true and `base_mod_env` is empty. If both conditions are met, it iterates through the nodes of the graph and constructs the environment and attributes recursively. The main function then continues to process the nodes, specifically handling nodes with the ""output"" operation by adding their outputs to the graph.```

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let's break down the information provided.

The issue title is ""[fx] split_module fails with no-op graph and keep_original_order=True"". This suggests that when using the `split_module` function with a no-op (no operation) graph and setting `keep_original_order=True`, it fails.

Looking at the body, the user provides code that triggers an error. They import necessary modules, create a function `fn`, trace it into a graph, and then call `split_module`. The problem occurs specifically when `keep_original_order` is set to True, leading to a KeyError: 'x_1'.

The error traceback shows that during execution of `split_module`, there's an attempt to access a key 'x_1' in a dictionary (`base_mod_env`) which doesn't exist. This indicates a runtime issue where the code crashes due to missing data.

The patches provided aim to fix this by adding checks and initializations when `keep_original_order` is True and certain conditions are met (like an empty `base_mod_env`). These changes ensure that necessary variables are populated before they're accessed, preventing the KeyError.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error"": this term refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, as opposed to compile-time or syntax errors. The issue here is exactly that—a crash happening when the code runs under specific conditions. Therefore, the label accurately captures the nature of the problem.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" is appropriate because the issue occurs during execution and results in an error.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report.

First, looking at the title: ""[fx] split_module fails with no-op graph and keep_original_order=True"". The word ""fails"" suggests an error is occurring when certain conditions are met.

In the body, the user provided a code snippet that reproduces the bug. They imported necessary modules and defined a function `fn` which returns a tuple. Then they used `make_fx` to create a graph `g`. When they run `split_module` with `keep_original_order=True`, it results in an error traceback.

The error message shows a KeyError: 'x_1', indicating that during execution, the code tried to access a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary. This is a runtime error because it occurs when the program is executed, not during compilation or build time.

Additionally, the user provided a patch which seems to address this issue by modifying how `split_module` handles certain cases, specifically when `keep_original_order` is True and `base_mod_env` might be empty. This implies that without the patch, the code raises an exception, which is a runtime error.

So, putting it all together, the label ""runtime error"" correctly describes the issue because the problem manifests during execution with an exception being thrown.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue as the problem occurs during execution and results in an exception.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""performance"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patch.

First, looking at the title: ""The max QPS of table creation by Lightning is slow & information_schema.tables getting slower causes lightning dispatch schema jobs slower in millions tables scenario."" This clearly mentions that the QPS (queries per second) for creating tables is slow. It also talks about the performance when dealing with a large number of schemas and tables, so it's related to how fast operations are being executed.

Next, the body describes a bug report where importing with 500k schemas and 1 million tables using Lightning is causing issues. The user provided a TiDB version, which indicates they're experiencing this problem in a specific context. The problem seems to be about efficiency when handling millions of tables, which again points towards performance issues.

Looking at the patch that resolved the issue: It modifies the concurrency setting for region operations. Previously, it was taking the minimum of the configured concurrency and 8, but now it's using the maximum between twice the concurrency configuration and 4. This change is aimed at increasing throughput by adjusting how many concurrent connections are used. By ensuring a higher minimum concurrency, the system can handle more operations simultaneously, which directly impacts performance.

So, putting this all together: The issue was about slow QPS and performance degradation with large-scale data, and the patch increases concurrency to improve speed. Therefore, labeling it as ""performance"" is appropriate because it's addressing how efficiently the system handles these operations.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""performance"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me read through everything carefully.

The title says that the max QPS of table creation by Lightning is slow, and information_schema.tables is getting slower, which causes schema jobs to be slower in a scenario with millions of tables. So right off the bat, it's talking about speed issues—slow QPS and slowdowns when handling many tables.

Looking at the body, it's structured as a bug report. Under minimal reproduce steps, they mention 500k schemas and 1 million tables using Lightning import, which is a large-scale scenario. They also included an image, but I can't see it, so I'll focus on the text provided.

In the TiDB version info, they're running v8.5.0-alpha with some specific build details. That's more about context than symptoms.

The user filled out sections 1 and 4 (repro steps and version), but didn't fill in what they expected to see versus what they saw. But from the title alone, it's clear that performance is a concern—slow operations and increased latency as the number of tables grows.

So the main issue here is about how fast Lightning can handle creating tables and querying information_schema.tables. Since these are both related to speed and efficiency, ""performance"" seems like an appropriate label. It's not about a bug in functionality but rather how well it performs under load.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, so I'm just focusing on whether ""performance"" fits. Given the context of QPS (queries per second) being slow and operations taking longer with more tables, yes, performance is definitely the right label here.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""cmd/compile: failed 'no write barrier' check compiling 'runtime' in TestAbstractOriginSanity"". The title mentions cmd/compile, which I know is part of Go's compiler command. So that suggests it's related to the compiler.

The body of the issue says that changes to runtime.throw caused a linker test using stronger inlining to fail the write barrier static reachability check. This indicates there's an issue with how the code is compiled or optimized, possibly involving the compiler's handling of certain checks or optimizations.

Now looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies the error message in the nowritebarrierrecChecker, adding a comment explaining that a function marked as nowritebarrierrec was found to call another function that involves a write barrier. This seems to be related to the compiler's analysis or checking during compilation.

Patch 2 changes the functions throw and fatal in the runtime package. They replace printpanicval(s) with printindented(s), which is noted to avoid a convTstring write barrier. So this patch is about modifying the runtime code to prevent triggering a write barrier issue, likely because of how the compiler optimizes or inlines functions.

Wait, but if the problem was caused by changes in the runtime package and fixed by modifying those functions, does that mean it's a runtime issue rather than a compiler issue? The initial failure is during compilation when the check fails. So the root cause seems to be in the code being compiled (runtime), but the detection of the issue happens during compilation.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". Since the problem arises from the compile step failing a check, and the fix involves modifying how functions are compiled or analyzed by the compiler (like inlining decisions), it makes sense that the issue relates to the compiler's behavior. The changes in Patch 1 are within the compiler code, adding comments about the error, which suggests they're improving the compiler's handling of such cases.

So even though some patches are in the runtime package, the issue is primarily about the compiler's checks and how it processes the code. Therefore, labeling it as ""compiler"" seems appropriate because the problem occurs during compilation and involves the compiler's static analysis.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""compiler"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""cmd/compile: failed 'no write barrier' check compiling 'runtime' in TestAbstractOriginSanity"". The cmd/compile part refers to the Go compiler command. So that's a clue that it's related to the compiler tool.

In the body, it mentions changes to runtime.throw causing a linker test failure because of stronger inlining. It specifically talks about a ""write barrier"" static reachability check. That seems like an issue during the compilation process, maybe with how the compiler is handling certain optimizations or checks.

The label given is ""compiler"". Since both the title and body discuss problems occurring when compiling, it makes sense that this issue is related to the compiler's functionality. The mention of cmd/compile directly ties it to the Go compiler, so the label seems appropriate.

I don't see any other aspects here that would suggest a different label like ""runtime"" or ""linker"", although linker issues are mentioned, the root cause seems to be in how the code is compiled. So yes, ""compiler"" fits well.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to compilation problems with cmd/compile.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on the provided context. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it just says ""[TurboModule] Add support for enums"". That doesn't immediately scream runtime error, but it's about adding functionality related to TurboModule and enums. So maybe it's a feature addition or a bug fix.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. It contains several patches that were made to resolve the problem. Let me examine these patches to understand what they're doing.

The first patch modifies some C++ files, adding methods related to `getStatusLowerCase` and changing the number of parameters in `getStateType`. This suggests that new functionality is being added to handle enums more effectively, perhaps ensuring that enum cases are correctly converted or accessed in JavaScript.

Patch 6 seems to be Objective-C code. It adds a method `lowerCase()` and modifies the `getStateType` method to include an additional parameter `d:(NSString *)d`. This indicates that the interface is being expanded to include new functionality, possibly related to string representations of enums.

In Patch 7, there's a JavaScript file where a function `generateEnum` is modified. The change involves using `toSafeCppString(member.name)` instead of just `member.name`, which suggests an effort to ensure that enum member names are correctly sanitized or converted for C++ compatibility. This could prevent runtime issues if the original strings had characters unsafe for C++ identifiers.

Looking at Patch 5, it adds a new method in Objective-C and modifies the way methods are invoked in the host functions. Specifically, `getStatusLowerCase` is added with its own selector, and `getStateType` now expects an additional argument. This could mean that without these changes, calling these methods might have led to runtime errors due to incorrect parameter counts or missing methods.

The mention of ""runtime error"" as a label suggests that the original issue was causing some kind of crash or unexpected behavior during execution. The patches seem aimed at correctly implementing enum support to prevent such issues. For example, if `getStateType` was expecting 4 parameters but only received 3 before, it might have caused a runtime error due to parameter mismatch.

Additionally, the change in how enum members are named (using `toSafeCppString`) could prevent issues where invalid characters in enum names cause build or runtime errors when used in C++ code.

Putting this together: The patches address adding proper support for enums, ensuring correct method signatures, and safely handling string conversions. These changes likely fix scenarios that would have caused runtime errors before, such as incorrect method calls or invalid parameter counts.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" seems appropriate because the issue was probably causing crashes or unexpected behavior at runtime, which these patches resolve by correcting method implementations and ensuring safe conversions.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue report. The patches address issues that would cause runtime errors, such as incorrect method calls and parameter mismatches.

1",0,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the provided GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""[codegen] inconsistent use of `toSafeCppString` in `generateEnum` (GenerateModuleH.js)"". The title suggests there's an inconsistency in how a function is used during code generation. This points towards a problem in the code generation step rather than something happening when the app is running.

Next, examining the body of the issue. The user describes that after running `pod install`, the generated ""SpecJSI"" files are broken. They provide a specific code fix by modifying how enum members' names are processed using `toSafeCppString`. This indicates that the issue arises during the build process when generating these files, not during runtime.

The steps to reproduce include installing a package, running `pod install`, and then building the project. The error occurs during the build, specifically in the generated header file. The stacktrace shows a compiler error where a member isn't found, which happens at compile-time, not runtime.

Additionally, the issue affects iOS and MacOS during the build, as stated under Affected Platforms. This further supports that it's a build or compilation problem rather than an error occurring when the app is running.

The provided stacktrace is from the build process, showing a missing member in the generated header file. This reinforces that the problem is with the generated code causing build errors, not runtime exceptions or crashes.

Considering all these points, the issue is about a build-time error due to incorrect code generation rather than an error occurring during app execution. Therefore, labeling it as ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately capture the nature of the problem.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" does not accurately reflect this issue because the problem occurs during the build process when generating code, leading to compiler errors, rather than during runtime.

Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""failure"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. So, first, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""[CI] CrossClustersEnrichIT testTopNThenEnrichRemote failing."" The title clearly states that a specific test is failing in their CI environment. That already points towards a problem where something isn't working as expected.

Next, I'll read through the body. It provides build scans, which are links to more detailed information about the failed builds. There's also a reproduction line with a Gradle command, which shows how someone could replicate this issue locally if needed. The applicable branch is main, which indicates it's a current problem in their primary codebase.

The failure message given is an IllegalStateException: ""Found 1 problem"" with details about incorrect optimization due to missing references. This suggests that there's a bug causing the test to fail because of some incorrect behavior or missing data during execution.

Looking at the issue reasons, it mentions multiple consecutive failures in different steps and pipelines, which reinforces that this isn't an isolated incident but a recurring problem. The failure rate percentages are provided as well, showing that while not extremely high, they're significant enough to warrant attention.

Now, examining the patches applied to resolve the issue. Patch 1 removes the test from being skipped or ignored by modifying the tests configuration file. This suggests that the test was failing and might have been disabled until the fix was implemented. Patch 2 adds some code changes related to the PlanConsistencyChecker class, specifically handling cases where EnrichExec with REMOTE mode is present. It looks like they added a check to skip certain validations when dealing with remote enrich operations, which probably prevents the IllegalStateException from occurring.

So putting this together: The issue was about a failing test in CI, caused by incorrect plan optimization leading to an exception. The patches fixed this by modifying how the consistency checker handles remote enrich operations and ensuring the test isn't disabled anymore.

The label ""failure"" is assigned here, which makes sense because it's about a test failure causing CI issues. However, I wonder if there are more specific labels that could be used, like ""bug"" or ""test-failure."" But given the options, ""failure"" does accurately describe the problem as it relates to the test failing and the resulting exception.

I don't see any information that would contradict the use of this label. The issue is clearly about a failure occurring in their CI pipeline due to a specific test case. Therefore, the label ""failure"" seems appropriate here.
</think>

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to a failing test in the CI environment with provided details and patches addressing the problem.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to determine whether the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[CI] CrossClustersEnrichIT testTopNThenEnrichRemote failing"". The word ""failing"" clearly indicates that there's a problem with a test case not passing. So, the title suggests that this is a failure in the CI (Continuous Integration) process.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. It starts by listing several build scans, which are links to specific parts of the CI builds. This already points towards an issue related to build failures or test failures. Then there's a reproduction line with a Gradle command that includes running a specific test method, which further supports the idea that this is about a failing test case.

Under ""Reproduces locally?"", it's marked as N/A, meaning they might not have checked if it can be reproduced locally yet, but that doesn't change the fact that there's an issue in the CI. The failure history link points to a dashboard showing past failures, which again indicates recurring issues.

The failure message provided is a Java exception: ""java.lang.IllegalStateException: Found 1 problem..."". This shows that when running the test, an exception was thrown, leading to a test failure. The specific error message about incorrect optimization due to missing references suggests there's a problem with how the code is handling certain variables or references during execution.

Looking at the issue reasons section, it lists several points like consecutive failures in steps and pipelines, as well as specific fail rates for tests and steps. All these points are about failures—tests failing multiple times across different runs and branches, which directly ties into why the label ""failure"" was applied.

Putting this all together: The title mentions a failing test, the body provides details of CI build failures with specific error messages, and the issue reasons outline multiple instances of test and step failures. All these elements consistently point to issues where tests or parts of the CI pipeline are failing. Therefore, the label ""failure"" is appropriate because it accurately captures the essence of the problem described in both the title and body of the issue report.

The label ""failure"" correctly reflects the issue as it pertains to test failures in the CI process.

Starting with the title: ""cmd/go: list confuses imports"". This suggests that the `go list` command is having issues related to how it handles or displays imports. The word ""confuses"" implies some sort of mix-up or incorrect behavior when dealing with import statements or dependencies.

Looking at the body, the user describes a problem where running `go list std cmd` doesn't show the expected information about the standard `math/rand` package. Instead, it seems to show dependencies compiled for `cmd/compile`. The issue is reported to have appeared between Go 1.20 and 1.21. The provided command outputs show that when using `std`, the imports are as expected, but with `std cmd`, the imports seem to be aliased or pointing to different paths, specifically those under `cmd/compile`.

Now examining the patches. Patch 1 modifies the function `setPGOProfilePath` by cloning both `Imports` and `Internal.Imports` slices when creating a new Package. The comment explains that this is done to prevent aliasing issues, ensuring modifications in one package don't affect another. This directly relates to how imports are handled internally.

Patch 2 adds a test case that checks if the `pgo` tool correctly splits off the Imports field so that modifications in one variant (like adding `.ForMain`) don't cause unexpected behavior in others. The test uses `go list` and compares outputs, focusing on import paths and their mappings.

Both patches are addressing issues where imports might be aliased or incorrectly referenced when using certain commands like `go list`, especially in the context of PGO (Profile Guided Optimization). This suggests that the root cause is related to how imports are managed internally by the Go toolchain.

The label assigned is ""import"". Considering all this, the issue revolves around how imports are handled and displayed by the `go list` command. The patches aim to fix incorrect import handling that leads to confusing or aliased imports in specific scenarios.

Therefore, the label ""import"" accurately reflects the nature of the problem described in the issue report.
</think>

Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""import"" correctly reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The issue's title is ""cmd/go: list confuses imports."" The word ""list"" here refers to a command in Go, specifically `go list`. From what I know, `go list` is used to display information about packages, including their dependencies and other details. The title suggests that the `go list` command isn't handling imports correctly.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user explains that when they run `go list std cmd`, it shows information about the math/rand package but seems to compile it for cmd/compile or include dependencies from there. They provide some commands and their outputs to illustrate this.

In the first command, `% go list -f '{{.Dir}} {{.Imports}}' std |grep /src/math/rand`, the output lists imports without any cmd/compile references. However, when they run it with `std cmd` as arguments, the imports now include packages like cmd/compile. This indicates that the presence of ""cmd"" is causing the math/rand package to be compiled differently or show dependencies from a different context.

The user mentions that this bug was introduced between Go 1.20 and 1.21.0, so it's a regression in the toolchain related to how `go list` processes imports when multiple packages are specified.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""import."" The issue is indeed about how `go list` displays import information, specifically when multiple arguments (like std and cmd) are given. It seems that `go list` is mixing up or confusing the imports from different contexts, leading to incorrect or misleading output.

I need to determine if ""import"" is an accurate label here. The problem revolves around the display of import dependencies in the output of a Go command, so it's directly related to how imports are handled and presented by `go list`.

There aren't any other obvious labels that might fit better here, like ""bug,"" which is too generic, or ""cmd/go,"" which refers more to the tool itself rather than the specific issue with imports. The key aspect of the problem is the incorrect import information, so ""import"" seems appropriate.

Therefore, after considering all these points, I agree that the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""import"" accurately reflects the issue because it concerns the `go list` command incorrectly displaying import dependencies when multiple packages are specified. The problem lies in how imports are processed and shown by the tool, making ""import"" a fitting label.

pytorch/pytorch,120020,layout,`Unknown layout` while initializing tensors,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

I am using the C++ Distributions of PyTorch 2.2.0 and following the setup and example from [here](<URL>

I am getting the following exception when running the code -

```The code snippet includes the necessary header for Torch library and defines the `main` function. It prints a 2x3 tensor filled with random values using Torch's random number generation function.```

```The log indicates that an `c10::Error` was thrown due to an ""Unknown layout"" at line 69 of `../c10/core/Layout.h`. The error originated from a call to `operator<<` and was propagated through multiple frames, ultimately terminating the program. The stack trace shows the error occurred within the `torch_cpu` library and was triggered by a call to `at::_ops::rand::call`.```

Tried to use other constructors of tensor and still it fails

`torch::tensor(1)`

```The log indicates that a `c10::Error` was thrown due to an unknown layout when calling the `operator<<` function. The error originated from `../c10/core/Layout.h:69`. The error was propagated through multiple frames in the stack trace, involving functions in `libtorch_cpu.so` and ultimately leading to a call from the user's `main()` function.```
Similar setup works with `torch< 2.2` but not with `torch==2.2.0`

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""layout"" correctly reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The user is encountering an error when using PyTorch's C++ distribution, specifically version 2.2.0. They provided a code snippet that's causing the exception. The error message says ""Unknown layout"" and points to the Layout.h file in the stack trace. This suggests that something's wrong with how tensor layouts are being handled.

Looking at the example they gave: when they run torch::rand({2, 3}), it throws this error. They also tried creating a tensor with torch::tensor(1) and got the same issue. So the problem isn't specific to one function but seems more general, affecting multiple tensor creations.

They mentioned that this worked in versions before 2.2, so something changed in 2.2 that introduced this bug. The user also included their environment details, which might be relevant for troubleshooting.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 updates a prerequisite section, increasing the required GCC version from 9.4.0 or newer to just 9 or later. It seems like they're relaxing the requirement a bit but still ensuring a modern enough compiler is used.

Patch 2 adds error checks for the compiler versions. Specifically, it prevents building with GCC older than 9 and Clang older than 9. This enforces that users have compilers supporting C++17 features properly, which might relate to layout handling in PyTorch.

So, why does this cause an ""Unknown layout"" error? I think it's because older compiler versions might not handle certain C++17 features correctly, especially those related to tensor layouts or memory management. If the compiler is too old, it can't generate code that properly sets up the tensor's layout, leading to this runtime error.

The label assigned was ""layout"". Given that the error message mentions ""Unknown layout"" and the patches are about ensuring the correct C++17 support which affects how layouts are handled, this seems appropriate. The issue is directly tied to problems with tensor layout initialization, so the label fits well.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""layout"" correctly reflects the GitHub issue described. Let's look at the title and body of the issue.

The title is ""`Unknown layout` while initializing tensors"". That immediately points towards a problem related to tensor layouts in PyTorch. The error message says ""Unknown layout"", which suggests that somewhere, the code is expecting a specific layout (like NCHW or NHWC) but isn't finding it or it's not set correctly.

In the body, the user provided code snippets where they're trying to create tensors using `torch::rand({2, 3})` and `torch::tensor(1)`. Both cases result in an error with ""Unknown layout"". They also mention that this works in versions prior to 2.2.0 but not in 2.2.0, which indicates a possible regression or change in how layouts are handled.

Looking at the stack traces, the errors originate from functions related to tensor creation and layout handling, like `at::_ops::rand::call` and `at::_ops::scalar_tensor::call`. These functions likely require a specific layout to be set when creating tensors. If the layout isn't provided or is incorrectly handled, it could throw this error.

In PyTorch 2.2.0, there might have been changes in how tensor layouts are managed by default. Maybe previous versions defaulted to a certain layout, but now it's requiring explicit specification. The user didn't specify a layout when creating the tensors, which could be why it's failing now.

The label ""layout"" seems appropriate because the issue revolves around the tensor layout not being recognized or set properly. It highlights that there's a problem in how layouts are handled during tensor initialization, which aligns with both the title and the body of the report.

rust-lang/rust,127018,network,std::net::TcpStream::connect_timeout on vxworks," I'm tracking a issue with connect_timeout function on rust for vxworks. The function is also accepting connections on a non responsive server port. I get errors on unreachable host, but with host that are reachable any connection to a non existent server port is not resulting in an error.

example program:

```The code snippet connects to a TCP socket address provided as a command-line argument within 5 seconds. It prints a success message if the connection is established, or an error message with the failure reason if it times out or fails for another reason.```

Results:

Does vxworks fall back on unix implementations for these functionalities? Any leads on how to proceed would be really helpful.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""network"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report based on the provided details.

First, looking at the title: ""std::net::TcpStream::connect_timeout on vxworks"". It mentions TcpStream and connect_timeout, which are related to network operations in Rust. So that's a clue pointing towards networking.

In the body of the issue, the user describes a problem where the connect_timeout function isn't behaving as expected when connecting to a non-responsive server port on VxWorks. They provided example code showing that connections to unavailable ports succeed instead of failing, which indicates an issue with how network connections are handled in this specific OS context.

The patches show changes to socket handling in the Rust standard library, specifically around error checking during connection attempts. The modifications adjust how errors are detected after a poll, especially for VxWorks, where POLLHUP or POLLERR aren't returned as expected. This is directly related to low-level network socket operations and error management.

Considering all these points, the problem revolves around network functionality, particularly how connections are managed and errors are reported in the TcpStream implementation on VxWorks. The label ""network"" accurately captures the essence of this issue.

First, looking at the title: ""std::net::TcpStream::connect_timeout on vxworks"". It mentions TcpStream and connect_timeout, which are related to networking in Rust. The function is part of the standard library's net module, which deals with network primitives.

Now, examining the body. The user describes an issue where the connect_timeout function isn't behaving as expected when connecting to a non-responsive server port on VxWorks. They provided example code that uses TcpStream::connect_timeout and observed unexpected successful connections when the server port doesn't exist, even though the host is reachable.

They also mention that this behavior isn't seen with the regular connect function, which suggests it's specific to how timeouts are handled in their environment. Additionally, they're asking about the underlying implementation, wondering if VxWorks falls back on Unix implementations for these functionalities, indicating that the problem might be related to low-level network handling or system calls.

The label ""network"" seems appropriate because the issue revolves around networking functions and their behavior under specific conditions. The user's problem is directly tied to how TcpStream handles connection timeouts, which is a network-related functionality.

I don't see any aspects of the issue that would fall outside the ""network"" category. It doesn't seem to be about build systems, documentation, or other areas. Therefore, assigning the ""network"" label accurately reflects the content of the issue.

rust-lang/rust,122211,unsoundness,byval argument of C ABI function passed to Rust ABI function has insufficient alignment,"

I tried this code:

```This Rust code defines a struct `HighAlign` with two 128-bit fields aligned at 16-byte boundaries. It also declares an external function `consume` that takes a reference to `HighAlign`. The `takes_aligned` function ensures that its `HighAlign` argument is properly aligned before calling `consume`.```

I expected to see this happen: Alignment requirements are upheld.

Instead, this happened: <URL>

```The code defines a function `@takes_aligned` that takes a pointer `%x` with high alignment of 4 and passes it to a function `@consume` with an alignment requirement of 16 before returning.```

`%x` is clearly not `align 16` as we indicate. This is unsound.

@rustbot label I-unsound A-ffi

---

This issue is somewhat similar to #80127. The fix for that issue, #112157, made this problem worse by causing Rust and `byval` alignments to differ in more cases. (That change is correct, because the Rust and `byval` alignment must differ to satisfy the ABI. It just uncovered this issue in more cases.)

This is also similar to #112480. However, unlike that one, this issue is practical (and easy) to fix. `byval` pointers are not exposed to Rust code, so we can just make a copy of the argument into a higher-aligned alloca, without breaking Rust semantics.

In fact, we already do this in the reverse situation, when the Rust alignment is lower than the `byval` alignment (<URL>
```The code defines a packed struct `LowAlign` with three 128-bit unsigned integer fields. It also declares an external C function `consume` that takes a `LowAlign` argument. Finally, it provides a Rust function `call_low_align` that calls `consume` with an instance of `LowAlign`, marked as `unsafe`.```
```The code defines a function `@call_low_align` that takes a pointer `%x` with alignment 1 and performs the following actions:
1. Allocates memory for a variable of type `%LowAlign` with alignment 4.
2. Copies 48 bytes from the input pointer `%x` to the allocated memory.
3. Calls a function `@consume` with the copied data.
4. Returns without a value.```

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, looking at the issue title and body, it seems related to passing structs with certain alignments across different calling conventions, specifically between Rust and C. The problem arises when there's a mismatch in alignment requirements, which can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes if not handled properly.

The user provided some code snippets and patches that were made to resolve the issue. From what I gather, the main problem was that when passing a struct by value (byval) with an alignment different from what Rust expects, the code wasn't correctly copying the argument into an alloca with the right alignment. This could lead to undefined behavior because the C code might expect a certain alignment that isn't met.

The patches include modifications to how arguments are handled when their alignment needs adjustment. For example, in some cases, the code now allocates space on the stack (alloca) and copies the argument into it with the correct alignment before passing it to the external function. This ensures that the called function receives the argument with the expected alignment, preventing potential issues like incorrect memory access or runtime errors.

The term ""unsoundness"" in programming languages refers to situations where a program can violate the language's safety guarantees, leading to undefined behavior. In this context, if the alignment isn't handled correctly, it could cause memory corruption or crashes, which are indeed unsoundness issues because they break the expected safety properties of the language.

Looking at the test cases provided in the patches, there are functions that check whether the argument is copied into an alloca when needed. For instance, on i686-linux, where the alignment might be lower than required, the code ensures that a copy with correct alignment is made before calling the external function. This directly addresses a potential source of unsoundness by preventing misaligned memory accesses.

Therefore, the label ""unsoundness"" seems appropriate because the issue relates to ensuring memory safety and correct behavior when interacting with C code, which is crucial for maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down the problem here. The user is reporting an issue with Rust where a struct passed by value to a C ABI function isn't maintaining its required alignment, leading to unsound code.

First, looking at the title: ""byval argument of C ABI function passed to Rust ABI function has insufficient alignment."" This suggests that when passing a struct from C to Rust using by-value semantics, the alignment isn't as expected. 

In the body, the user provides some Rust code and the generated LLVM IR. The struct HighAlign is defined with an alignment of 16 bytes. However, in the compiled output, the argument %x has an alignment of only 4 bytes, which clearly violates the required alignment. This is a problem because if the data isn't properly aligned, it can cause runtime errors or crashes.

The user mentions that this issue is similar to previous ones like #80127 and #112480, but this one is easier to fix by making a copy into a higher-aligned alloca. They even provide an example where Rust does this correctly when the alignment is lower than required, using memcpy to adjust it. 

So, the core issue here is about memory alignment not being upheld, which can lead to undefined behavior in the program. This is a clear case of unsoundness because the compiler isn't ensuring that the data is accessed in a way that adheres to its alignment requirements, potentially leading to incorrect or crashing code.

The label ""unsoundness"" was assigned. Since this issue directly relates to memory safety and alignment violations, which are fundamental to soundness in programming languages, especially low-level ones like Rust, I think the label fits perfectly. The problem could cause the program to behave unpredictably due to misaligned data access, which is a classic example of unsoundness.

I don't see any other labels that would better describe this issue. It's not just a bug or a performance issue; it's a soundness problem because it can lead to incorrect behavior without any runtime checks catching it. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the severity and nature of the problem reported.
</think>

The label ""unsoundness"" is appropriate here as the issue involves memory misalignment leading to potentially unsafe code execution.

ziglang/zig,22362,regression,@errorName not working on selfhosted x86-64 backend,"### Zig Version

0.14.0-dev.2577+271452d22

### Steps to Reproduce and Observed Behavior

Compile this program on linux x86-64:
```The code snippet defines a `main` function that calls `foo`. If `foo` returns an error, `main` catches it and prints the error name using `@errorName`. The `foo` function intentionally returns `error.OutOfMemory` to demonstrate error handling.```
running selfhosted
```The command runs the Zig program `main.zig` without using LLVM or lld for compilation and linking.```
gives
```The code snippet provided is `fMemory`. It appears to be a function call, but without additional context, it's not possible to provide a more detailed summary.```
and running llvm backend gives
```The code snippet `zig run main.zig` is a command to run a Zig program named `main.zig`.````
```The log indicates an ""OutOfMemory"" error.```

On 0.13.0 it works correctly so its regression

### Expected Behavior

I expect output of first and second run to be the same (e.g. ""OutOfMemory"")",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" correctly reflects this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression is. From what I know, a regression in software terms is when a bug or issue is introduced in a newer version of the software that wasn't present in an older version. It's essentially a step backward in functionality.

Looking at the title: ""@errorName not working on selfhosted x86-64 backend"". That tells me there's an issue with the errorName function on a specific setup, which is self-hosted and uses x86-64 architecture. 

Now, diving into the body of the issue. The user provided steps to reproduce, including code snippets and expected behavior. They mentioned that when compiling a certain program using the selfhosted backend (with -fno-llvm and -fno-lld flags), the output is ""fMemory"" instead of ""OutOfMemory"". However, when using the LLVM backend, it works correctly. Importantly, they note that this wasn't an issue in version 0.13.0, which suggests that the problem started after that version.

So, this fits the definition of a regression because something that worked before stopped working in a newer version (0.14.0-dev). The user expects both backends to produce the same output but they don't anymore.

Looking at the patches provided: 

- Patches 1 and 2 seem to modify how error names are handled internally, possibly fixing how strings are stored or referenced.
- Patch 3 adds a test case to check both LLVM and non-LLVM backends, ensuring that the issue is caught in testing.
- Patch 4 exports the errorName function properly.

These patches address the root cause of the bug. Since the problem arose after a previous version worked correctly, labeling it as a regression makes sense because it's an unintended reintroduction of a bug or a new bug that impairs functionality compared to earlier versions.

Therefore, yes, the label ""regression"" accurately reflects this issue report.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression means in software terms. From what I remember, a regression is when a bug or issue appears in a newer version of the software that wasn't present in an older version. It's like taking two steps forward and one step back.

Looking at the title of the issue: ""@errorName not working on selfhosted x86-64 backend"". That tells me there's an issue with the errorName function specifically when using a self-hosted setup on x86-64 architecture. The problem is that it's not functioning as expected, so something's wrong here.

Now diving into the body of the issue. The user provides steps to reproduce and observed behavior. They shared some Zig code that uses @errorName and expects it to print ""OutOfMemory"". When they run this with the selfhosted backend using specific flags (-fno-llvm -fno-lld), the output is ""fMemory"", which is incorrect. But when they use the LLVM backend without those flags, it correctly outputs ""OutOfMemory"".

They also mention that in version 0.13.0, this worked correctly, but now with 0.14.0-dev, it's broken. So the problem started after an update. That fits the definition of a regression because something that used to work no longer does.

The expected behavior is for both runs (selfhosted and LLVM) to produce the same output, which isn't happening. The user clearly states this as a regression since it worked in 0.13.0 but fails now.

So putting it all together: the issue describes a problem that was introduced in a newer version of Zig, which is exactly what a regression label is meant for. Therefore, assigning the ""regression"" label is appropriate here.

spring-projects/spring-framework,32575,runtime error,RestClient observations are stopped before ResponseSpec calls,"Debugging a `RestTemplate` shows that `execute()` bad responses are properly throwing exceptions, which when caught, are setting the error to the observation:
```The code snippet performs the following steps:
1. Executes a request and stores the response.
2. Sets the response in an observation context.
3. Handles the response by calling a method with URL, method, and response as parameters.
4. Extracts data from the response using a response extractor if available, otherwise returns null.
5. Catches and handles `IOException`, creating a `ResourceAccessException` and rethrowing it after logging the error.
6. Catches and logs any other `Throwable`, then rethrows it.```
Doing the same for the `DefaultRestClient` `retrieve` method shows that the `clientRequest.execute()` call is not throwing any exception, thus no error is recorded to the observation (later during the `toEntity` call the exception is thrown, but at that time the client observation is already stopped).
```The code snippet captures a try-catch block that executes a client request, handles exceptions, and logs errors. It sets the client response in an observation context, wraps the response, and exchanges it. Catch blocks manage `IOException` and other `Throwable` exceptions, creating and throwing `ResourceAccessException`.```

What is the idea of the new RestClient implementation, how is it supposed to propagate the exception to the observation?",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""RestClient observations are stopped before ResponseSpec calls."" This suggests that there's a problem with how observations (like logging or monitoring) are being handled in the RestClient. Specifically, the observation is stopping too early, before certain response handling occurs.

The body of the issue provides more details. It compares two implementations: RestTemplate and DefaultRestClient. In RestTemplate, when execute() throws an exception, it's caught and the error is recorded to the observation. However, in DefaultRestClient, during the retrieve method, clientRequest.execute() doesn't throw any exceptions, so no error is logged to the observation. Later, when toEntity is called, an exception is thrown, but by then, the observation has already stopped.

The patches provided show changes made to fix this issue. Let me go through them:

1. **Patch 1** modifies several parts of the code:
   - It adds a parameter `observation` to the method `readWithMessageConverters`.
   - In cases where exceptions are caught, it sets the error on the observation before throwing.
   - It ensures that observations are stopped in the `finally` block after processing.

2. **Patch 2** updates test methods and class names for better clarity, but doesn't directly relate to the bug fix.

The main idea here is ensuring that any exceptions during response handling are properly recorded by the observation before it stops. The problem was that observations were stopping too early, missing error logging when exceptions occurred later in the process.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, such as null pointer exceptions or array index out of bounds. However, this issue isn't about a specific error occurring but rather about the timing and completeness of error logging within observations.

The patches are about ensuring that when exceptions do occur (like RestClientException), they are properly captured in the observation before it's stopped. So the problem is more about correct error handling and logging mechanisms rather than a runtime error itself.

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""runtime error"" might not be accurate because the core issue isn't an unexpected error during execution but rather a flaw in how errors are being logged or tracked.
</think>

The label does not accurately reflect the issue. The problem was about ensuring proper error logging and observation handling, not a runtime error.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the problem described.

The issue's title says that RestClient observations are stopped before ResponseSpec calls. The body explains that in RestTemplate, when there's an exception during execute(), it's caught and set as an error in the observation. But in DefaultRestClient's retrieve method, clientRequest.execute() doesn't throw any exceptions, so no error is recorded in the observation. Later, when toEntity is called, the exception is thrown, but by then the observation has already stopped.

So, the main problem seems to be that in one part of the code (RestTemplate), exceptions are properly caught and logged in observations, but in another part (DefaultRestClient), this isn't happening because the exception occurs after the observation has been stopped. The user is asking about how the new RestClient should propagate exceptions to the observation.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an issue that occurs during the execution of the program, like divide by zero or null pointer exceptions. In this case, the problem isn't exactly a crash due to a runtime error; it's more about how exceptions are being handled and recorded in observations.

The issue here is about exception handling and logging mechanisms not working as intended in certain parts of the code. It's more of a bug related to error tracking or monitoring rather than a runtime error causing the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

So, does ""runtime error"" capture this issue? I don't think so because it's not an error that's occurring at runtime in terms of crashing, but rather an incorrect behavior in how errors are recorded. The label might be too broad or misleading here.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue described. The problem is about improper exception handling affecting observations, not a runtime error causing crashes.

golang/go,67428,integration,x/tools/gopls/internal/test/integration/codelens: spurious TestGCDetails_Toggle failure,"`````The code snippet is a watchflakes rule that matches packages from `golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/test/integration/codelens` and tests whose names start with `TestGCDetails_Toggle/`.```

Observed in one builder in the context of <URL> test passed after re-try.

```The test `TestGCDetails_Toggle/default` failed after 2.01 seconds. The test expected that after toggling GC details, there would be diagnostics for `main.go` mentioning ""42 escapes"" with an ""optimizer details"" diagnostic of severity Information and no tags. However, this condition was not met. The log shows that the view was created, packages were loaded, and some diagnostics were performed, but the specific diagnostics for `main.go` were missing.```
",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""integration"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title mentions a spurious failure in TestGCDetails_Toggle within the codelens integration tests. The body describes a test that's failing because of an unmet condition related to diagnostics, specifically looking for a message containing ""42 escapes"" with certain severity and tags. It also notes that the test passed on retry, which suggests it might be a flaky test.

Looking at the patches provided, Patch 1 modifies the test by replacing AfterChange with OnceMet, adding a CompletedWork condition before checking the Diagnostics expectation. This seems to adjust how the test waits for certain diagnostics to appear after specific work is done. 

Patch 2 updates the comment for the DoneDiagnosingChanges function, clarifying that it's about awaiting various document and workspace change notifications before checking expectations. It also adds a more detailed description of what AfterChange awaits, including different textDocument and workspace events.

Now, considering the label ""integration."" Integration tests typically verify interactions between components or systems, ensuring they work together as expected. The changes here are in test setup and expectations, making the test more reliable by correctly awaiting certain conditions before checking for results. This isn't adding new integration points but rather fixing how the existing integration test behaves.

So, while the issue is about an integration test failure, the patches don't add or modify integration aspects per se; they adjust the test's timing and expectations to prevent spurious failures. Therefore, the label ""integration"" might not be the most accurate because it doesn't directly relate to integrating components but rather to test reliability.

However, since the issue is within an integration test file and involves how the test integrates with the server's behavior, there's a case for the label being appropriate. But I'm leaning towards it not being the best fit because the core problem was about test flakiness due to timing issues, not integration logic.
</think>

The label ""integration"" is somewhat relevant as the issue pertains to an integration test. However, the patches address test reliability rather than integrating components. 

Answer: 0",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""integration"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided title and body. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The title of the issue is: ""x/tools/gopls/internal/test/integration/codelens: spurious TestGCDetails_Toggle failure"". The word ""integration"" is part of the path here, which suggests that this test is related to integration tests for the codelens feature in the gopls tool. So right away, it seems like an integration test failure.

Looking at the body, there's a watchflakes command that's filtering for a specific package and test name: TestGCDetails_Toggle. The user mentions that this test failed in one builder but passed on retry, which points towards a flaky test issue. They also provided the output showing the failure details, including messages about unmet conditions and logs from the test run.

The key here is understanding what the label ""integration"" means. Typically, integration labels are used for issues related to integration tests—tests that check how different parts of the system work together. Since this issue is specifically about a failing integration test, the label seems appropriate. The failure details don't indicate a bug in the code itself but rather an issue with the test's reliability.

I also note that the problem occurred in the context of a specific CL (change list), which might be related to recent changes affecting the integration tests. However, since the test passed on retry, it's more about the test's stability rather than a functional bug.

So putting it all together, the label ""integration"" accurately reflects that this is an issue with an integration test failing sporadically. There's no indication that another label like ""bug"" or ""test-flake"" would be more appropriate, although those could also apply. But since the primary aspect here is the integration test failure, ""integration"" fits well.

",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this issue report based on the information provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is saying.

The user provided a series of patches from a GitHub repository and some test cases. The main focus seems to be around fixing issues related to joining tables, especially when dealing with large data types like bigint unsigned and bit(64). There are tests added in Patches 21 and 24 that check if certain joins behave correctly when comparing these large integer types.

Patch 1 through Patch 20 show various code changes, but they don't add new features. Instead, they seem to fix existing bugs or improve how the system handles specific data types during joins. For example, in Patch 17, there's a change in checking the length of segments which might be related to handling larger data without causing errors.

The labels given by GitHub are important here. The issue report was assigned the label ""enhancement."" But looking at the patches and test cases, it seems like these changes are addressing specific bugs or improving correctness rather than adding new features. Enhancements usually refer to new functionalities or significant improvements, not necessarily bug fixes.

Moreover, the tests added in Patches 21 and 24 are testing for correct behavior when comparing different integer types across tables. This suggests that prior to these patches, there might have been incorrect results or errors when performing such joins, indicating a bug fix rather than an enhancement.

So, considering all this, I don't think ""enhancement"" is the right label here. These changes are more about fixing issues and improving correctness rather than introducing new features or enhancements.
</think>

0",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the information given.

The title of the issue is ""Support hash join spill."" That sounds like a feature request because it's asking for support for something specific, which implies adding a new capability or improving an existing one.

Looking at the body, it's structured as a feature request with several sections. The user starts by mentioning that their request is related to a problem and describes what they want. They also consider alternative solutions and discuss teachability, documentation, adoption, and migration strategies. All of these points are typical in feature requests where someone is proposing an addition or improvement to the existing software.

The label ""enhancement"" is generally used for issues that suggest new features or improvements. Since this report is clearly a request to add support for hash join spill, it fits under the enhancement category rather than being a bug report or something else.

I don't see any indication that this is about fixing a bug; it's more about adding functionality. Therefore, assigning the ""enhancement"" label seems accurate here.

The issue report is a feature request to add support for hash join spill, which fits under the enhancement category as it's about adding new functionality rather than fixing a bug.

php/php-src,15657,crash,Segmentation fault in ext/opcache/jit/ir/dynasm/dasm_x86.h,"### Description

The following code:

```This PHP code defines an interface `I` with a getter property `prop`. It then creates a class `A` that implements this interface, providing a private property `_prop` and a public property `prop` with a getter method that returns the value of `_prop`.```

Resulted in this output:
```The log indicates an AddressSanitizer error resulting in a segmentation violation (SEGV) on an unknown address `0x7f698aba28e0`. The error is caused by a write memory access. The stack trace points to the `dasm_encode` function in `dasm_x86.h` at line 415, which is part of the JIT compilation process in PHP's opcache extension.```

To reproduce:
```The code snippet sets configuration options for PHP's OPCache and JIT compiler in a PHP INI file format. It includes enabling OPCache, specifying JIT settings, and configuring preload and implicit flush behavior.```


### PHP Version

PHP 8.4.0-dev

### Operating System

ubuntu 22.04",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. 

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Segmentation fault in ext/opcache/jit/ir/dynasm/dasm_x86.h"". A segmentation fault is a type of runtime error that occurs when a program attempts to access memory it shouldn't, which typically leads to a crash. So the title itself suggests a crash.

Next, examining the body of the issue: The user provided a PHP code snippet that resulted in an AddressSanitizer error, specifically a SEGV (segmentation violation) due to a WRITE memory access. This indicates that the program crashed because it tried to write to an invalid memory address. The stack trace points to functions related to the JIT compiler and opcache, which are part of performance optimizations in PHP.

The patches provided include changes in the opcache code where there's a comment referencing this issue (GH-15657) and mentioning that they fixed a bug causing a segmentation fault. Additionally, Patch 2 shows modifications around JIT handling, disabling it temporarily to prevent the crash during certain operations. This confirms that the issue was indeed causing a crash related to memory access violations.

Patch 3 adds a test case that triggers the bug by implementing an interface with a property, which leads to the crash. The test expects the script to output ""Done"" without crashing, ensuring that the fix works.

The label assigned is ""crash"", which aligns well with all these observations: the issue caused a segmentation fault leading to a program crash, and the patches were aimed at preventing this crash by managing JIT compilation correctly.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""crash"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title: ""Segmentation fault in ext/opcache/jit/ir/dynasm/dasm_x86.h"". Segmentation faults are typically related to crashes because they indicate memory access issues that cause a program to terminate abruptly.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. The user provided some PHP code and the output it generated when run. The output shows an error from AddressSanitizer about a SEGV (segmentation violation) on an unknown address. This definitely points to a crash because the program isn't handling memory correctly and is trying to access an invalid location, leading to termination.

The stack trace provided starts with dasm_encode in dasm_x86.h at line 415. The presence of a stack trace usually indicates that something went wrong during execution, which aligns with a crash scenario rather than just a minor bug or performance issue.

Additionally, the user included steps to reproduce the problem, which is helpful for others to test and confirm if it's indeed causing a crash. They also mentioned their PHP version and OS, which adds context but doesn't change the fact that it's a crash-related issue.

The label ""crash"" seems fitting because the issue revolves around a segmentation fault causing program termination, as evidenced by both the title and the detailed body with error messages and stack traces.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it involves a crash due to a segmentation fault.

",1,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this issue report. 

Looking at the problem description, it seems like there are various errors related to incorrect time or datetime values during ALTER TABLE operations. For instance, when trying to modify a column from one type to another (like bigint to datetime), an error occurs because the value doesn't fit the new type.

Now, considering what a runtime error is: typically, it refers to an error that happens while the program is executing, not at compile time. These errors can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. In this case, the errors are happening during runtime when executing specific SQL commands, so they do fit into the runtime error category.

The patches provided also adjust how these errors are handled, ensuring that invalid values lead to appropriate errors rather than incorrect behavior. This aligns with fixing runtime issues where operations fail due to invalid data or constraints.

So yes, the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the problem described.
</think>

1",0,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided title and body.

First, let's read through the issue details. The title says that a generated column returns an illegal timestamp value. In the body, the user describes creating a table with a datetime column 'a' and a generated timestamp column 'b' that references 'a'. They insert a date far in the future, '9999-01-01', which is valid for MySQL but might be problematic elsewhere.

The expected behavior in MySQL shows that when inserting this date, the generated timestamp column 'b' becomes '0000-00-00 00:00:00', which is the zero date. However, in TiDB, 'b' returns the same date as 'a', which is '9999-01-01 00:00:00'. The user points out that this value isn't a legal timestamp.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during execution, causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. In this case, the issue is about incorrect data being returned rather than the application crashing or throwing an exception.

The problem here is that TiDB doesn't handle the date correctly according to the user's expectations, leading to an illegal timestamp value. This seems more like a bug in how generated columns are processed, specifically with timestamp types and their allowed ranges. It might be better categorized under something like ""bug"" or ""incorrect behavior,"" rather than a runtime error.

So, the label assigned doesn't accurately reflect the issue because it's not causing a crash or runtime exception but is instead about incorrect data handling.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" does not accurately reflect this issue. The problem is about incorrect timestamp handling, not a crash or execution error.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is ""Nilpointer in dartsass.Close"". That immediately tells me that there's a null pointer exception happening somewhere in the Close method related to dartsass. 

Looking at the body, it starts with a note about an underlying error possibly being masked. The user mentions Hugo 0.139.0 dropping support for v1 of Dart Sass embedded protocol, which might still be in use by some old versions. They also provided a link to another discussion about a panic when building on Netlify.

The stack trace shows that the build script failed with exit code 2. It mentions a runtime error due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference. Specifically, it points out that the Close method in dartsass.Transpiler was called on a nil (zero) value, leading to a segmentation violation.

Now, looking at the patches applied:

Patch 1 seems to adjust how resources are handled in a template file, changing from `resources.PostCSS` to `css.PostCSS`. Not directly related to the nil pointer in Close, but perhaps part of a broader fix.

Patch 2 is more substantial. It modifies the New function in client.go to return an empty Client instead of setting dartSassNotAvailable when Dart Sass isn't supported. The struct for Client loses the dartSassNotAvailable boolean and adds a comment that transpiler may be nil if Dart Sass isn't available. The Close method now checks if transpiler is nil before attempting to close it, preventing the nil pointer dereference.

Putting this together, the issue was indeed a runtime error caused by calling Close on a nil transpiler instance. The patches fix this by properly checking for nil before closing and adjusting how the Client is initialized when Dart Sass isn't available.

The label ""runtime error"" fits because the problem occurred during execution due to an invalid memory access, which is a type of runtime error.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me look at the title and body of the issue.

The title is ""Nilpointer in dartsass.Close"". A nil pointer exception typically occurs when trying to access a null or uninitialized pointer, which is indeed a type of runtime error because it happens during execution.

Looking at the body, there's an error message: ""panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference."" This explicitly mentions a runtime error. Additionally, the stack trace shows a segmentation violation and a SIGSEGV signal, both of which are indicators of runtime issues.

The body also discusses the removal of support for v1 of Dart Sass embedded protocol in Hugo 0.139.0, suggesting that the problem might be related to outdated binaries, but the immediate error causing the crash is a nil pointer dereference, which falls under runtime errors.

So both the title and body clearly point to a runtime issue. Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate here.

The label accurately reflects the issue as it involves a runtime error due to a nil pointer exception.

JuliaLang/julia,57141,bug,v1.12 throws `UndefVarError: not defined in local scope` for variable renamed in function before being captured by a closure,"~I've not yet been able to create a minimal reproduction of this that doesn't depend on a private package (sorry), but~ i can at least start a bisect to try to find the offending commit.

[Edit: better repro in message below]

In a private package, which has a function like
```This Julia code defines a function `assign_node_ids` that assigns unique IDs to nodes in a graph structure. It supports an optional starting ID. If no starting ID is provided, it defaults to starting from 0. The function uses a recursive helper function `_traverse` to traverse and reassign IDs to nodes. The main function returns the modified node structure and the next available ID. A second, simpler function is provided to call the first with a default starting ID of 0 if none is specified.```
Calling the function like
```The code snippet creates a node using `make_node` and then assigns IDs to the node using `assign_node_ids`.```
throws
`````The log indicates an `UndefVarError` stating that the variable `ii` is not defined in the local scope. It suggests checking for a local variable assignment that might be shadowing a global variable of the same name. The error occurs at line 104 of the `traversal.jl` file in the `Utilities` module of the `RAI_BackIR` package.```

The error disappears if the function is marked `@noinline` or the variable isn't renamed in the function, i.e.
```The code snippet defines a Julia function `assign_node_ids` that assigns node IDs starting from a given integer. The function is marked with `@noinline`, indicating that the compiler should not inline this function.```
or 
```The code snippet defines a Julia function `assign_node_ids` that takes a `node` and an integer `ii` as arguments. The function body is omitted.```

",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the problem described.

The title mentions that v1.12 throws a `UndefVarError` for a variable renamed in a function before being captured by a closure. So, it seems like there's an error occurring where a variable isn't defined when it should be, specifically related to closures capturing variables after renaming.

Looking at the body, the user provides code snippets and explains that when they run their function, it throws this UndefVarError. They mention that marking the function with `@noinline` or not renaming the variable fixes the issue. This suggests that there's something wrong with how the compiler is handling variable renaming in functions that have closures.

Now, the patches provided are two. The first patch modifies some code related to sroa_pass!, which I think is part of the compiler's optimization passes, maybe for Single Return Optimization or something similar. It adds a filter to remove uses that have been optimized away by DCE (Dead Code Elimination). 

The second patch seems to add a test case where it checks that `setfield!` isn't eliminated when the field is used. This might be related to ensuring that certain optimizations don't incorrectly remove code that's actually needed, which could cause variables to not be defined as expected.

Putting this together, the issue arises from how the compiler optimizes or handles variable scoping in closures, leading to a variable being undefined. The patches aim to fix this by adjusting optimization passes and adding tests to prevent such issues. Since this is an unintended behavior causing errors, it fits the definition of a bug rather than a feature request or enhancement.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue because it describes a problem in the code that needs fixing.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate as the issue describes an unexpected error due to a variable not being defined, which is caused by a flaw in how the compiler handles closures and optimizations. The provided patches aim to correct this behavior.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is: ""v1.12 throws `UndefVarError: not defined in local scope` for variable renamed in function before being captured by a closure."" That immediately tells me that there's an error occurring when using Julia version 1.12, specifically related to a variable not being defined in the local scope.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user describes encountering an UndefVarError with the variable `ii` when running their code. They provided a code snippet showing how they're trying to use this variable within nested functions and closures. The error message suggests that Julia can't find `ii` in the local scope during execution.

The user also mentions that the issue disappears under certain conditions: if the function is marked with `@noinline` or if the variable isn't renamed, like changing it from `starting_id` to `ii`. This indicates that the problem might be related to how the compiler handles variable renaming and inlining of functions.

In software development, a ""bug"" typically refers to an unintended behavior in the code that causes it to fail or produce incorrect results. Since this issue is about the Julia language throwing an error when certain conditions are met (like variable renaming before being captured by a closure), it's pointing out a problem with how Julia handles these specific cases.

The user isn't just reporting a mistake in their own code; they're indicating that there's something wrong with how Julia's compiler or runtime is handling the code. The fact that modifying the function with `@noinline` or changing variable names works around the issue suggests that it's not a problem with their code logic but rather an underlying issue in Julia itself.

So, considering all this, labeling this report as a ""bug"" makes sense because it's highlighting unexpected behavior in the language's handling of closures and variable scoping. It's not a feature request or a question about how to do something; it's clearly an issue that needs to be fixed by the maintainers.

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report as it describes unexpected behavior in the Julia language, specifically an error related to variable scope within closures when certain conditions are met.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""performance"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue report provided. Let me break down what's in the issue and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""AOTAutograd has_same_metadata call in collect_metadata_analysis.py is quadratic."" The word ""quadratic"" here suggests that there's an issue with the algorithm's time complexity. Quadratic time can lead to performance problems because as the input size increases, the time taken grows rapidly.

Next, the body of the issue describes a bug where running a benchmark with N set to 1000 shows a quadratic behavior in a specific part of the code. The user provided a profile image, which likely shows that the function is taking too much time. They also mention that this happens when using AOTAutograd, which relates to ahead-of-time compilation for autograd functions—something that's performance-sensitive.

Looking at the patches applied:

Patch 1 changes how tensors are stored and compared. Instead of a defaultdict(set), they're now using a more structured approach with MetadataKey. This suggests an optimization where instead of checking each tensor for metadata equality, which could be O(n^2) time, they're grouping them by their metadata keys first. So the comparison becomes faster because you only compare tensors that share the same metadata key.

Patch 2 introduces a new dataclass called MetadataKey and modifies the has_same_metadata function to use this key. This likely reduces the number of comparisons needed by creating a hashable key for each tensor's metadata, allowing for quicker lookups and thus reducing the overall time complexity from quadratic to linear or near-linear.

Patch 3 adds SymIntEqByExpr, which changes how integer expressions are compared. Instead of using their values directly, they use the underlying sympy expressions. This ensures that comparisons are done based on the structure of the expressions rather than just their integer values, which could prevent unnecessary equality checks and speed up the process.

Putting this all together: The issue was about a quadratic time complexity causing performance degradation. The patches restructure how metadata is handled to reduce the number of comparisons needed, thus improving performance by reducing the time taken from O(n^2) to something more efficient.

So yes, the label ""performance"" accurately reflects this issue because it's all about optimizing the code to run faster and handle larger inputs without a significant slowdown.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""performance"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""AOTAutograd has_same_metadata call in collect_metadata_analysis.py is quadratic."" The word ""quadratic"" here suggests that something is scaling poorly, which usually relates to performance issues. Quadratic time complexity implies that as the input size increases, the time taken increases rapidly, which is a common problem in software performance.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. The user provided a reproduction script and mentioned a specific code snippet where the quadratic behavior occurs. They even included a profiling image, which likely shows that this particular function call is taking up a significant amount of time or resources. Profiling data is typically used to identify performance bottlenecks.

Additionally, the context given involves benchmarking with N set to 1000, which is a substantial size for input. This indicates that they're testing under conditions where performance issues would be noticeable. The code snippet provided seems to loop through tensors and check metadata, which if done inefficiently, could indeed lead to quadratic scaling.

The user also tagged several people, which might indicate it's a known problem area in their project, possibly related to optimization or speed improvements—both of which fall under performance.

So putting this all together: the title mentions a quadratic issue (performance-related), the body provides evidence through profiling and specific code causing the slowdown, and the context is about benchmarking. All these elements strongly suggest that the problem is indeed a performance issue.

The label ""performance"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves a quadratic time complexity problem affecting efficiency.

Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""cmd/go: TestScript/build_json failures [consistent failure]"". The word ""failures"" here suggests that there are test failures occurring. The term ""[consistent failure]"" indicates it's a recurring problem.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It mentions a specific test case, TestScript/build_json, which is failing consistently. The example log shows that the test output doesn't match the expected pattern, leading to a failure. This confirms that the test is indeed failing and causing issues with the build process.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Both Patch 1 and Patch 2 modify the expected output in the test cases by adjusting regular expressions to account for different path separators (using (/|\\\\)). This change aims to make the tests more robust across different operating systems, particularly handling both Unix and Windows path formats correctly.

The label assigned is ""failure"". The issue report is about a failing test, which directly relates to a failure in the system. The patches address this by fixing the test's expected output, which suggests that without these changes, the tests would continue to fail, hence the issue is indeed about a failure scenario.

Therefore, considering all aspects—title indicating failures, body detailing the specific failed test, and patches aimed at correcting those failures—the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue.
</think>

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to consistent test failures addressed by patches.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""cmd/go: TestScript/build_json failures [consistent failure]"". The use of ""failures"" and ""[consistent failure]"" clearly indicates that something is going wrong with the test. That suggests the issue is about a failing test case.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It starts with a watchflakes comment, which I know is related to monitoring flaky tests in Go. The example provided shows an error log from running TestScript/build_json. There's a failure message indicating that the stdout didn't match the expected output. Specifically, it says ""FAIL: testdata\script\build_json.txt:6..."" and mentions no match for a certain regex pattern. This means the test is failing because the actual output doesn't align with what was expected.

The body also includes details about the environment variables and the command being run, but the key point is that the test consistently fails. The issue was created automatically to track these failures, which further supports that it's a problem needing attention.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""failure"". Since the entire report revolves around a test failure that's consistent, the term ""failure"" seems appropriate. It directly addresses the issue's core—something isn't working as expected in the codebase or tests.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but even if there were, ""failure"" captures the essence here. There's no indication of it being a feature request, bug, or anything else—it's straightforwardly about a test failing repeatedly.

So putting it all together: title mentions failures, body details the specific test failure with logs and environment info, label is ""failure"". It seems to fit perfectly.
</think>

The issue report clearly discusses a consistent test failure in TestScript/build_json. The assigned label ""failure"" accurately reflects this scenario as both the title and body detail the failing test.

go-gitea/gitea,31738,runtime error,Internal Server Error on push (GetAffectedFiles()),"### Description

I was testing how branch protection works and if it is possible to protect modification of `.gitea/actions` from being modified in a PR. As far as I understand, Gitea is executing actions code from a PR, and not from `main`, but this must be another issue.

Here is the following bug.
If branch protection is set for branch `*` all pushes to new branches will fail with ""`Gitea: Internal Server Error (no message for end users)`""

How to reproduce:
1. Create a branch protection for branch `*`, set protected files to `.gitea/**;mkdocs.yml;mkdocs.yaml`, push - `Enable Push`
2. clone repo via ssh, and do:
```The log shows the creation and switching to a new Git branch named `pr-test`, adding and committing a file named `text.txt`, and attempting to push the changes to a remote repository hosted on Gitea. The push operation fails due to a ""pre-receive hook declined"" error, indicating that a server-side hook prevented the push from completing successfully.```

(Without protected files it works - this is how a new branch was created on demo.gitea)

`gitea.log` has following entries (hashes are differ from example above):
```The log indicates several errors occurred while processing operations on the `someorg/doc-test` repository located at `/data/git/repositories/someorg/doc-test.git`. Specifically:

1. An invalid repository was encountered.
2. An error occurred while trying to get affected files for certain commits.
3. An error happened while checking file protection for those commits.
4. A server error was logged due to an internal API issue during the hook pre-receive process.```

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: ""Internal Server Error on push (GetAffectedFiles())"". This suggests that when pushing changes, an internal server error occurs, specifically mentioning a function called GetAffectedFiles(). Internal Server Errors usually indicate something went wrong on the server side, often due to unhandled exceptions or bugs in the code.

Next, I'll examine the issue body. The user describes how they encountered this problem while testing branch protection settings. When pushing to a new branch with certain protected files set, it results in an internal server error. They provided steps to reproduce the issue, including Git commands and the resulting error message. The logs from gitea.log show errors related to GetAffectedFiles() failing with exit status 128, indicating that there was a problem executing this function.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve the issue:

- Patch 1 adds new test functions related to getting commit branch starts.
- Patch 2 modifies the GetAffectedFiles function to handle cases where oldCommitID is empty by fetching the start commit of the branch.
- Patches 3 and 4 adjust how branches are retrieved, passing environment variables correctly.
- Patches 5 and 6 update functions like preReceiveBranch, CheckFileProtection, and CheckUnprotectedFiles to include the branch name in their parameters.

These changes suggest that the issue was due to incorrect handling of commit IDs when the oldCommitID was empty (like when pushing a new branch). The GetAffectedFiles function wasn't correctly determining the start commit for branches, leading to an error during file protection checks. This caused the internal server error because the pre-receive hook failed.

The term ""runtime error"" typically refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as null pointer exceptions, division by zero, or unexpected conditions that weren't handled properly. In this case, the problem was an unhandled scenario where oldCommitID was empty, leading to incorrect function behavior and thus causing the server to crash with an internal error.

Therefore, labeling this issue as a ""runtime error"" is appropriate because it points to a flaw in the code's execution flow that wasn't properly handled, resulting in a server-side error.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue because it stems from unhandled conditions during code execution leading to an internal server error.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Internal Server Error on push (GetAffectedFiles())"". This immediately suggests that there's an internal server error happening when pushing something, specifically mentioning a function or method called GetAffectedFiles(). Internal server errors are usually runtime issues because they occur during the execution of the application when it can't handle a request properly.

Next, examining the body. The user describes setting up branch protection and encountering an internal server error when trying to push changes. They provided steps to reproduce, which include creating a protected branch and pushing a new file. The push fails with a remote rejection message indicating a pre-receive hook declined due to the error. 

The logs provided are crucial here. They mention ""GetAffectedFiles() [E] Unable to get affected files for commits... exit status 128"" and ""preReceiveBranch() [E] Unable to check file protection..."" which leads to an internal server error via SSH. Exit status 128 in Git often refers to a fatal error, possibly indicating that the process couldn't execute properly.

So, putting this together: The issue is about an internal server error happening during a push operation, specifically when branch protections are set up. The logs show that the function GetAffectedFiles() is failing with exit code 128, which suggests a runtime problem—like a crash or inability to handle the request correctly. This isn't about incorrect functionality or a feature request; it's about the application encountering an error during execution.

The label ""runtime error"" fits because it refers to errors that occur during the execution of the program, as opposed to compile-time errors. The internal server error and exit status 128 point to something going wrong while Gitea is trying to process the push request, which aligns with a runtime issue.

rust-lang/rust,131834,runtime error,Drop the dereferenceable attribute when a reference is passed in an enum,"Considering [the following code](<URL> it should print 0 with a release build, but I get a segmentation violation.

```This Rust code defines a restricted address type `RestrictedAddress` with a specific valid range for its underlying pointer. It also defines an enum `E` with variants that include `RestrictedAddress`. The function `foo` matches on the enum and dereferences the `RestrictedAddress` if the variant is `A`, otherwise returns 0. The `main` function calls `foo` with a black-boxed `E::B` to prevent optimization.```

This is because we are adding the `dereferenceable` attribute, which allows LLVM to hoist the load instruction. In this case, we need to drop the `dereferenceable` attribute.

@rustbot label +requires-nightly +I-miscompile +A-codegen",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title says: ""Drop the dereferenceable attribute when a reference is passed in an enum."" Hmm, that sounds like it's about how the Rust compiler handles certain attributes related to pointers or references in enums. The body of the issue includes some Rust code and explains that running this code causes a segmentation fault instead of printing 0 as expected.

Looking at the provided Rust code, it uses some internal features like `rustc_attrs` and defines a struct `RestrictedAddress` with specific layout attributes. There's an enum E with variants, one of which takes a `RestrictedAddress`. The function `foo` matches on the enum and tries to dereference the `RestrictedAddress` if it's variant A; otherwise, it returns 0.

The problem arises when running this code in release mode—it causes a segmentation violation. The user explains that this happens because the `dereferenceable` attribute is added, allowing LLVM to hoist the load instruction, which isn't safe here. They want to drop this attribute to fix the issue.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies the `PointeeInfo` struct, adding more fields and comments about how the information is advisory and can cause UB if wrong. It seems to be adjusting how pointer info is handled.

Patch 2 changes how data variants are determined in the codegen. It adds checks for whether a pointer is null or dereferenceable by examining the enum's structure and tag encoding. It ensures that only certain conditions allow the pointer to be considered safe, which might prevent incorrect optimizations.

Patch 3 updates `ArgAttributes` comments to clarify that `dereferenceable_or_null` is used instead of `dereferenceable`. This suggests a change in how these attributes are applied, making sure they're only set when appropriate.

Patch 4 modifies some test cases. It adds a new function with checks for non-null and non-dereferenceable pointers, ensuring that the compiler doesn't incorrectly apply attributes in cases where it's unsafe.

Now, considering all this, the issue is about incorrect code generation leading to a runtime error (segmentation fault). The patches aim to correct how the compiler handles pointer attributes to prevent such errors. 

The label assigned was ""runtime error."" Since the problem manifests as a crash during execution and the patches fix codegen to avoid that, the label seems appropriate because it correctly identifies that the issue causes an error at runtime.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The issue's title is about dropping the dereferenceable attribute when a reference is passed in an enum. The body includes some Rust code and explains that running it with a release build results in a segmentation violation instead of printing 0 as expected. 

Looking at the problem, the user mentions that the code should print 0 but gets a segfault. Segfaults are typically runtime errors because they occur during execution when the program tries to access memory incorrectly.

The issue is related to how LLVM optimizes the code with the dereferenceable attribute, leading to incorrect behavior. This seems like a miscompilation or code generation bug rather than something that would manifest as a compile-time error. The provided labels include ""runtime error"", which fits because the problem happens when running the program.

So, I think the label is correct here because it's about an issue occurring at runtime due to incorrect optimizations affecting memory access.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it describes a runtime error (segmentation violation) caused by incorrect code generation.

**Reproduction URL**

- Using the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin: <URL>
- Using the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin: <URL>

**Describe your issue**

When using `@tailwindcss/vite`, and creating an SSR build with Vite, the CSS asset paths differ between the SSR and client builds. This is not true with `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

The above repos contain a minimal reproduction case, starting from a fresh React Vite project. Here are the reproduction steps below showing the bug:

With the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin:

```The logs show two builds executed using `bun` and `vite`. The first build targets the client-side application, producing various assets including CSS and JavaScript files, with the build completing in 463 milliseconds. The second build targets the server-side application, generating an SSR bundle in 55 milliseconds. The `entry-ssr.js` file contains a reference to the client-side stylesheet located at `/assets/App-DX11wV_z.css`.```

Note the asset path of the built `App.css` differs between the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css !== App-DWNkNxeI.css`). This means that SSR rendered responses have the incorrect asset URL (which leads to a hydration error, if you are hydrating – or a missing CSS asset if you are only SSR rendering).

With the `@tailwindcss/postcss` based plugin:

```The script performs the following steps:

1. Builds the client-side application using `bun build:client`.
2. Builds the client-side application with Vite, outputting to `build/client`, and generates a manifest file.
3. Builds the server-side application using `bun build:server`.
4. Builds the server-side application with Vite, outputting to `build/server` and using `src/entry-ssr.tsx` for SSR.
5. Searches for the inclusion of the client-side CSS asset path in the server-side build output, confirming that `/assets/App-BYq-i2yi.css` is included.```

Note the asset path of the built `App.css` matches the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css === App-BYq-i2yi.css`).

Let me know if I can provide any more information.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects this issue report. Let me start by looking at the problem.

The user provided a lot of code changes and mentioned that they're related to the Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS. From what I can see, these changes are modifying how the plugin interacts with the build process, specifically around dependency handling and rebuild triggers.

I remember that in the past, there was an issue where adding or changing files outside of the main configuration wouldn't trigger a rebuild. This caused problems because developers expected their Tailwind styles to update when they added new classes or components elsewhere.

Looking at the patches, it seems like the main focus is on how dependencies are tracked. The `requiresBuild` method now checks file modification times instead of relying on a flag (`requiresRebuild`). Also, there's better handling of build dependencies by using a map to track file paths and their last modified times.

This suggests that the problem was with the plugin not detecting changes correctly in certain scenarios. By improving how dependencies are monitored, the plugin becomes more reliable. It ensures that any relevant file changes trigger a rebuild, which is crucial for a seamless development experience.

The label ""plugin"" makes sense here because all these changes are within the Vite plugin codebase. They're not core Tailwind CSS features but rather how the plugin integrates with Vite's build system.

So yes, labeling this as a plugin issue accurately reflects that the problem lies within the plugin's functionality and its interaction with the build environment.
</think>

The label ""plugin"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to the Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS, focusing on dependency handling and rebuild triggers within the plugin.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down whether the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue.

First, looking at the title: ""Inconsistent CSS assets between client and SSR builds with @tailwindcss/vite"". It mentions a specific plugin, @tailwindcss/vite, which immediately points towards it being related to a plugin issue.

The body of the issue provides detailed reproduction steps using two different plugins: @tailwindcss/vite and @tailwindcss/postcss. The problem arises when using the Vite plugin, where asset paths differ between client and SSR builds, leading to issues like hydration errors or missing CSS assets. 

The user provided URLs to minimal reproduction repositories, which helps in diagnosing whether it's a plugin-specific problem. They also compared the behavior with another plugin (@tailwindcss/postcss), where the issue doesn't occur. This comparison suggests that the problem is specific to how the @tailwindcss/vite plugin handles asset paths during builds.

The core of the issue revolves around the functioning of the plugin within Vite, particularly during SSR builds. The incorrect asset paths are generated because of how the plugin processes CSS assets in different build environments (client vs. server). Therefore, the problem is directly tied to the plugin's behavior and not a general Vite or Tailwind CSS issue.

Considering all this, the label ""plugin"" is appropriate because it directly relates to the functioning and potential bug within the @tailwindcss/vite plugin when used with Vite's build process, especially in SSR scenarios. The issue isn't about a feature request or documentation but rather a problem arising from the plugin itself.
</think>

The label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to the behavior of the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin during builds.

The tests also attempt to access a deeply nested directory path, resulting in a ""permission denied"" error.```

Assigning to @ianlancetaylor as he has worked on this test previously.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""os: TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet failing on android trybots."" This tells me that a specific test, TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet, is failing on Android build bots. So the problem is related to a test failure in the 'os' package when running on Android.

Now, reading the body of the issue. The user provided logs from the failed tests. Both TestGetwdDeep and TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet are failing because they're trying to open a directory with a path that's way too long, leading to a permission denied error (EACCES). They also mentioned that this happens consistently on Android trybots.

The patches made to fix this issue change the error handling in the test. Originally, it was checking for EPERM and logging it as an ignorable error. The patch changes this to check for EACCES instead, which is the correct error code for permission issues. This makes sense because when the test tries to access directories higher up that it doesn't have permissions for on Android, it should expect EACCES rather than EPERM.

So the issue here is about a failing test caused by incorrect error handling in the test code itself. The problem isn't a runtime error in the production code but rather an issue with how the test handles errors during execution. The test was expecting the wrong type of error, leading to failures when run on Android.

The label ""runtime error"" typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the program, not during testing. Since this is a test failure due to incorrect error handling in the test code, it's more about test reliability rather than a runtime problem.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue because the problem lies within the test cases and how they handle specific errors on certain platforms, not an actual runtime error in the application itself.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" is incorrect for this issue. The problem was with a failing test due to improper error handling, not a runtime error.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""os: TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet failing on android trybots."" The test is failing consistently on Android trybots. That suggests there's an issue with how the test behaves when run on those specific systems.

Now, looking into the body of the issue. The user provided example output from a build log. There are two test failures: TestGetwdDeep and TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet. Both tests seem to be related to getting the current working directory (getwd). 

In both cases, the tests start with various lengths for Getwd, then end with a Getwd len of 0 followed by an error message: ""open ... permission denied."" The first test has this after reaching 4093, and the second test reaches 4103 before failing.

So, what's happening here? It looks like when trying to open a directory many levels deep (like ../../../.. repeated), the system returns a permission denied error. That could be because the path exceeds the maximum allowed length or perhaps it's attempting to access a restricted area beyond its permissions.

The user also assigned this issue to someone who worked on the test before, suggesting it might relate to the test's implementation or setup.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the program, like null pointer exceptions, division by zero, etc. But in this case, the failure is due to a permission denied error when trying to access a deeply nested directory. 

Is this a runtime error? Or is it more accurately categorized as something else, such as an OS-related issue or a file system access problem?

I think ""runtime error"" might be too broad here. The problem seems specific to how the test interacts with the filesystem on Android, possibly hitting a limit or permission constraint when trying to access very deep paths.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the environment setup—like the PWD (Present Working Directory) being set in a way that causes issues during testing.

So, does ""runtime error"" capture this accurately? Or is there a more precise label like ""file system issue,"" ""permission error,"" or ""test failure""?

In this context, since the test is failing due to an inability to access certain directories (permission denied), and it's related to getting the working directory, I'm leaning towards thinking that ""runtime error"" isn't the most accurate. It seems more like a filesystem or environment-specific issue.

Therefore, I would say the label doesn't accurately reflect the problem described in the issue.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for Tensor.add_ not checking for errors."" The title suggests that there's a problem with how fake tensors are handling the add_ operation in Dynamo, specifically related to error checking.

The body provides more context. It mentions a similar issue and includes a reproducible example using pytest. When running the test, an error occurs because of a type mismatch—trying to cast Float to Long, which isn't allowed. The traceback shows a RuntimeError during the execution of the compiled function, indicating that Dynamo didn't handle this correctly.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies some test files by removing an xfailIfTorchDynamo decorator from a test method. This suggests that previously, tests were failing under TorchDynamo but now they're expected to pass, meaning the issue is resolved.

Patch 2 adds several checks in the meta_binop_inplace_alpha function. It introduces functions like is_integeric, is_floatic, and is_booleanic to determine the types of operands. Then it explicitly raises RuntimeErrors when trying to perform operations that would change the element size, such as adding a float to an integer tensor or mixing boolean with non-boolean tensors in-place.

These changes seem to fix the issue by properly checking for type promotions that aren't allowed in in-place operations, thus preventing silent failures and ensuring correct error handling.

So, putting it all together: The problem was that Dynamo's fake tensor implementation wasn't correctly checking for certain type errors during in-place operations like add_. This caused incorrect behavior or unexpected results. The patches fix this by adding proper checks and raising appropriate errors when such invalid operations are attempted.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" is accurate because it describes a defect in the code where Dynamo didn't handle these cases correctly, leading to runtime errors instead of properly preventing type mismatches.
</think>

The issue report accurately describes a bug where Dynamo's fake tensor implementation failed to check for specific error conditions during in-place operations, causing incorrect behavior. The patches address this by adding necessary checks and error handling.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the title and body of the issue. The title says there's a fake tensor implementation in Dynamo that isn't checking for errors when using Tensor.add_. So right away, it sounds like something might be wrong with how Dynamo handles certain operations.

Looking at the body, the user provided a reproducible example. They wrote a function f(x) where they try to add 1.5 to x using x.add_(). If this fails, they return x + 1; otherwise, x + 2. But when they run it with torch.compile and an int64 tensor, there's an error about the result type Float not being castable to Long.

Hmm, so what's happening here? The add_() method is supposed to handle in-place addition. Adding a float (1.5) to an integer tensor should either cause an error or upcast the tensor. But it looks like in this compiled version with Dynamo, instead of catching the error and executing the except block, it's causing a runtime error.

That suggests that Dynamo isn't properly handling the type checking for add_(), which is part of PyTorch's functionality. The fake tensor implementation should ideally catch such errors during the operation, but here it seems to let it pass through, leading to an unexpected result or crash. 

The issue report includes a traceback pointing to a RuntimeError, indicating that this is a bug in how Dynamo processes the add_() method on tensors of different data types. It's not behaving as expected when there's a type mismatch, which should be caught and handled properly.

So, considering all this, labeling it as a ""bug"" makes sense because it points to incorrect behavior in the code when using specific operations under certain conditions.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate since the issue describes unexpected behavior due to improper error handling in Dynamo's Tensor.add_ implementation.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down whether the label ""failure"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the issue title: ""[CI] ShardBulkInferenceActionFilterIT testBulkOperations {p0=false} failing."" This clearly indicates that a specific test case is failing in the CI environment. The presence of ""failing"" in the title suggests that the problem is related to a test failure.

Next, examining the body of the issue provides more details. It mentions build scans with multiple links, which likely point to failed builds where this issue occurred. There's a reproduction line showing how to run the failing test locally, though it notes that it doesn't reproduce locally, which might mean it's an intermittent or environment-specific issue.

The failure message is ""Test abandoned because suite timeout was reached,"" indicating that the test didn't complete in the allowed time, leading to a timeout. This is another type of failure—specifically, a timeout failure.

Looking at the reasons for the issue: there are multiple failures mentioned across different steps and pipelines, such as part-2 step and elasticsearch-pull-request pipeline. These all point to recurring issues that are causing test failures consistently over several runs.

Now, considering the patches made. Patch 1 removes some failing tests from being executed, which suggests that these specific tests were problematic. Patches 2 and 3 modify how certain operations are handled in the codebase, possibly addressing the root cause of the timeout or failure in those tests. The changes relate to synthetic source handling and snapshot creation, which could be directly causing the test failures if not optimized properly.

Putting it all together: the issue is about a failing test case in CI, supported by specific error messages and multiple instances across different builds. The patches aim to fix these failures either by removing problematic tests or adjusting underlying code that caused timeouts or incorrect behavior. Therefore, the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue as it's centered around test failures and their resolution.
</think>

The label ""failure"" is appropriate because the issue report describes a failing CI test with supporting evidence in build scans and failure messages. The patches address these test failures by modifying code and removing problematic tests.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""failure"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the provided title and body.

The title is ""[CI] ShardBulkInferenceActionFilterIT testBulkOperations {p0=false} failing"". That immediately tells me that there's a failing test in the CI (Continuous Integration) system. The test mentioned is testBulkOperations with a parameter p0 set to false, and it's part of the ShardBulkInferenceActionFilterIT class.

Looking at the body, I see several build scans linked, which are likely related to where this failure occurred. There's also a reproduction line, which is a command to run the test that's failing. The applicable branch is main, so this is happening in the main branch of the repository.

The issue notes whether it reproduces locally as N/A, which probably means it's not necessary or hasn't been checked yet. Then there's a link to the failure history dashboard, indicating that this isn't an isolated incident but something that's been happening over time.

The failure message is ""java.lang.Exception: Test abandoned because suite timeout was reached."" That suggests that the test didn't fail due to an assertion error or incorrect logic but rather because it took too long and exceeded the allowed time limit. So, the test suite timed out during execution.

Under the issue reasons, it's mentioned that there are 5 failures in this specific test with a low fail rate (1.8% over 280 executions), along with some other related step and pipeline failures. The note at the end explains that this issue was created automatically by new test triage automation, so it's part of an effort to track failing tests systematically.

Now, considering the label ""failure"". The term is pretty broad and can encompass various types of issues—like test failures, build failures, or functional failures in code. In this context, since the problem is a test failure due to timeout, assigning the ""failure"" label makes sense because it's indicating that something is failing (the test) in the CI system.

I don't see any information that would contradict the use of this label. The issue is clearly about a failed test, which fits under the umbrella of ""failure"". There aren't other labels mentioned here, but even if there were more specific ones like ""test-failure"" or ""timeout"", the general ""failure"" label still accurately describes the problem.

Therefore, I think the label does reflect the issue accurately.
</think>

The label ""failure"" is appropriate because the issue reports a test failure in the CI system. The test times out, indicating a problem that needs attention.

This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ci"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

Looking at the title: ""[CI] MvPercentileTests testEvaluateBlockWithoutNulls {TestCase=field: <positive mv DEDUPLICATED_AND_SORTED_ASCENDING longs>, percentile: <small positive double>} failing."" It mentions a CI build and a specific test failure. The body provides details about the build scans, reproduction steps, applicable branches, and the failure message which is an assertion error between two long values.

The patches show changes in the code related to how percentiles are calculated and tested. They modified functions to use matchers that allow for a range of acceptable values instead of exact matches, especially for longs where a small variance is permitted due to potential precision issues with large numbers.

Now, considering the label ""ci"": CI stands for Continuous Integration. This issue was detected because a test started failing in the CI pipeline. The problem wasn't directly about the code functionality but rather the test's expectations not accounting for possible minor variations in results when dealing with very large long values. Therefore, the fix involved adjusting the test assertions to be more flexible.

So the label ""ci"" accurately reflects that this issue was identified through the CI process and relates to test failures within that context.
</think>

The label ""ci"" is appropriate because the issue arose from a failing test in the Continuous Integration pipeline, as indicated by the title and body. The patches addressed the test's assertion logic to accommodate expected variations.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""ci"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided title and body.

First, looking at the title: it mentions ""[CI] MvPercentileTests testEvaluateBlockWithoutNulls..."" which immediately tells me that this is related to a Continuous Integration (CI) process. The brackets around CI indicate that it's part of the CI setup or reporting.

Now, moving on to the body. It lists several ""Build Scans"" with links, which are typical in CI/CD pipelines where each build is tracked and scanned for issues. There's also a section on how to reproduce the issue using a Gradle command, which suggests it's an automated test failure that occurred during the build process.

The applicable branches are mentioned as 8.x, which indicates this is part of the versioning in the CI environment. The ""Reproduces locally?"" is marked as N/A, implying that this issue isn't about local development but rather the CI environment where the tests run automatically.

The failure message shows an AssertionError with specific expected and actual values, pointing to a test case that's failing. This kind of error is common in automated testing within CI pipelines. The ""Issue Reasons"" section mentions multiple failures in a specific test case, which further supports that this is a recurring problem in the CI environment rather than an isolated local issue.

Additionally, there's a note at the end mentioning that this issue was created using new test triage automation, which is often part of CI/CD tools to automatically report test failures. The link provided directs to a dashboard, likely for monitoring build statuses and failure rates, another hallmark of CI systems.

Putting it all together, every section of the body reinforces that this issue pertains to the CI environment. The labels in GitHub help categorize issues so teams can address them appropriately. Since this is about a failing test in the CI pipeline, labeling it as ""ci"" makes sense because it's directly related to the automated testing and build processes.

I don't see any information here that would suggest another label is more appropriate or that ""ci"" isn't fitting. The focus is on test failures within builds, which is exactly what the CI label should capture.
</think>

The issue report clearly relates to a failing test in the Continuous Integration environment, as evidenced by references to build scans, automated test failures, and specific CI-related details.

rust-lang/rust,122652,feature request,Disable const-stability checking for intrinsics with fallback MIR?,"As suggested in <URL> I moved my new intrinsic to `core::intrinsics`.  But that meant I started getting a new error:

Is that error useful for things with fallback MIR that's already const-checked?  Could we skip it?

(Maybe doing that in the same PR that would make CTFE capable of using fallback MIR?)

",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""feature request"" accurately reflects the given issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is showing.

First, there's an issue report with various patches applied to a repository. The question is whether assigning the label ""feature request"" to this issue is correct based on its title, body, and the provided patches.

Looking at the patches, I see that they modify several files related to Rust's intrinsics. For example, Patch 28 adds `#[rustc_intrinsic]` and `#[rustc_intrinsic_must_be_overridden]` attributes to a function, which suggests changes in how certain intrinsic functions are handled or exposed by the compiler.

Intrinsics in Rust are low-level functions that are part of the standard library but are implemented in a way that bypasses the usual ABI. They're often used for performance-critical operations. Modifying these intrinsics could be about adding new functionality, changing their behavior, or improving how they're handled by the compiler.

The patches also include changes to error messages and tests, like adjusting when certain errors are thrown during constant evaluation. For example, in Patch 23, it looks like there's a test that checks if using `copy_nonoverlapping` with invalid pointers correctly throws an error. This indicates that the issue might be about ensuring the intrinsics behave correctly under various conditions.

Another patch (Patch 27) deals with transmuting function pointers to intrinsic functions, which again relates to how these low-level operations are handled by the compiler and runtime.

Now, considering what a ""feature request"" typically entails. A feature request usually involves adding new functionality or making enhancements to an existing system. The patches here seem more about fixing bugs or improving the internal handling of intrinsics rather than adding a new user-facing feature.

However, sometimes changes to intrinsic functions can be part of larger feature work, like improving performance or enabling new language features that rely on these intrinsics. But in this case, the focus seems to be on correct behavior and error handling rather than introducing a new feature per se.

Alternatively, if these patches are part of adding support for a new feature that relies on updated intrinsics, then ""feature request"" might make sense. For example, if a new language feature requires changes to how certain intrinsics work, then this could be considered as part of the feature's implementation.

But without more context from the issue title or body, it's hard to say definitively. Based solely on the patches provided, they seem more like bug fixes or internal improvements rather than a feature request. Feature requests usually involve adding something new that users can utilize, whereas these changes are under-the-hood adjustments.

So, if the issue is about improving how intrinsics work internally without exposing new functionality to end-users, then labeling it as a ""feature request"" might not be accurate. It would be more appropriate for bug fixes or internal improvements.

However, I could be missing some context where these patches are indeed enabling a new feature, making the label correct. But based on what's shown here, I'm leaning towards it not being a feature request.
</think>

0",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""feature request"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by analyzing the issue's title and body.

The title is ""Disable const-stability checking for intrinsics with fallback MIR?"" This suggests the user is asking about modifying how stability checks are handled for certain intrinsic functions, specifically those that have a fallback MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation). The question is whether these checks can be disabled or skipped.

Looking at the body, the user describes an error they encountered after moving their intrinsic to `core::intrinsics`. They received an error stating that `typed_swap` isn't yet stable as a const fn. They're questioning if this error is useful when there's already fallback MIR with const-checking in place. They also ask if it's possible to skip this error and suggest considering it in the same PR that would enable CTFE (Constant Tensor Expressions) to use fallback MIR.

Now, considering the labels: ""feature request"" typically refers to a suggestion for adding new functionality or changing existing behavior. The user isn't reporting a bug but is instead proposing a change in how stability checks are handled for certain intrinsics. They're seeking to disable these checks under specific conditions and possibly integrate this with another feature (CTFE using fallback MIR). This seems more like a request for a new feature or an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

However, sometimes such requests might also be categorized under ""enhancement."" But since the label provided is ""feature request,"" which generally encompasses enhancements and new functionalities, it still fits appropriately here. The user isn't reporting a problem that needs fixing but is instead suggesting an improvement or change in functionality.

Therefore, the label ""feature request"" accurately reflects the content of the issue as the user is proposing a modification to how const-stability checks are applied rather than reporting a bug.
</think>

The label ""feature request"" correctly captures the essence of the issue. The user is requesting a new feature or change in functionality regarding how stability checks are handled for intrinsics with fallback MIR.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""runtime"" is appropriate for this issue based on the provided information. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions test failures in various tests like testFallbackIndicesOptions and others. These are failing with specific error rates across different executions. So the problem seems to be related to testing infrastructure or how certain parts of the code behave under particular conditions.

Next, I check the patches provided. The first patch removes some test classes from a test suite. It specifically mentions removing tests related to ClusterRequestTests and an issue number linked to that change. The second patch modifies a method in the test class, changing how versions are handled when creating a test instance. Instead of using a version between 8.14.0 and 8.16.0, it now uses versions up to just before 8.16.0.

This suggests that the issue was related to compatibility or behavior changes in different versions of Elasticsearch, particularly around how cluster requests are handled when falling back to older indices. The test was probably failing because it was using a version range that included 8.16.0, which might have introduced some breaking changes or behaviors that the tests weren't expecting.

The label ""runtime"" typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the software, such as performance problems, crashes, or incorrect behavior when running the application. In this case, since the issue was causing test failures due to how versions were being handled in the code under test, it does relate to the runtime environment. The tests are part of ensuring that the runtime behaves correctly across different versions.

Therefore, the label ""runtime"" seems appropriate because the problem is about how the system behaves during execution when handling different transport versions and cluster requests. The patches adjust version handling to prevent the tests from failing, which directly impacts the runtime behavior of the application.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""runtime"" is appropriate for this issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: it mentions test failures in various steps with specific failure rates. This suggests issues related to testing, possibly due to some instability or bugs causing inconsistent results across different executions.

In the body, there's a detailed error message from an EsqlConfiguration, including pragmas like ""data_partitioning"" set to ""SHARD"", and some query details. The issue seems to involve problems with Elasticsearch queries, perhaps related to data retrieval or processing.

The problem is about test failures occurring in different parts of the pipeline, such as testFallbackIndicesOptions, part3 steps, and specific pipelines like elasticsearch-intake and elasticsearch-pull-request. These are all parts of a system's workflow, particularly around testing and CI/CD processes.

The note at the end mentions this was created using new test triage automation, asking for feedback on es-delivery. This indicates that it's related to internal tools or delivery pipelines, which often involve runtime environments where these tests execute.

Now, considering the label ""runtime"": does it fit here? The term ""runtime"" typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of code, such as errors in running applications, performance problems, or environment-related issues. In this case, the test failures are happening when executing specific steps or pipelines, which could be due to runtime environment misconfigurations, dependencies failing during execution, or bugs in the code that only manifest under certain conditions.

The alternative labels might include ""test"" or ""CI/CD"", but since the focus is on why these tests are failing and given the mention of data partitioning and query configurations, it points towards issues happening during runtime when executing these operations. Therefore, ""runtime"" seems appropriate as it reflects problems occurring during the execution phase in a distributed or sharded environment.

So, yes, I think the label accurately reflects the issue described.

Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Repo Topic Containing Backslash Leads to Javascript Error."" The word ""Error"" is present, and it specifically mentions a JavaScript error. So that's a clue pointing towards a runtime issue because JavaScript errors typically occur during execution.

Next, looking at the body of the issue, there's an error message provided. The error says: ""Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-value=""test\""]"". This looks like a JavaScript error from jQuery, as it references jquery.js with line numbers. Since this error occurs when creating a repo topic with a backslash, it's happening during the execution of the code, which suggests it's a runtime problem.

The user also mentions that it's unclear if it's an escape code issue or a larger problem, but the presence of an error message indicates something went wrong when the code tried to execute. They provided steps to reproduce, which involves interacting with the repository settings—again, something that happens at runtime.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. There are multiple patches, but I'll focus on a few key ones. Patch 2 modifies how values are encoded using encodeURIComponent without trying to decode first. This change directly affects how data is handled when the code runs, preventing incorrect encoding that could cause syntax errors.

Patch 3 changes an event handler from 'touchstart' to 'click', which affects how user interactions are processed in real-time. Incorrect event handling can lead to runtime errors if elements aren't properly selected or if events aren't correctly captured.

Another patch (numbered 8) removes some code related to Fomantic API patches, which was causing issues with URL encoding. This suggests that the original problem might have been due to incorrect handling of URLs during execution, leading to runtime errors when certain characters were present.

Additionally, in Patch 3 again, there's a change where data-value attributes are now using CSS.escape instead of deQuote. This ensures that any special characters like backslashes are properly escaped in selectors, preventing the JavaScript errors seen at runtime.

Considering all these points—the error message, the reproduction steps involving user interaction, and the patches addressing encoding and event handling—it seems clear that the issue is a runtime error occurring when the application tries to process certain input, leading to exceptions being thrown.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the title and body of the issue carefully.

The title is ""Repo Topic Containing Backslash Leads to Javascript Error."" This suggests that when a repository topic includes a backslash, it causes some kind of JavaScript error. 

Looking at the body, the user provides more details. They mention encountering an error with a specific message: ""Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-value=""test\""]"". The stack trace points to lines in jQuery files, which indicates that this is related to JavaScript execution. 

They explain how to reproduce the issue by creating a repo topic named ""test\"" and hitting enter. This action leads to the JavaScript error. They also mention that they can reproduce it on the Gitea demo site, which confirms it's a consistent problem.

The label assigned here is ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, as opposed to compile-time or syntax errors. In this case, the JavaScript error happens when the user interacts with the application (adding a topic), which fits the definition of a runtime error because it's occurring while the code is executing.

I should also consider if there are more specific labels that might apply, such as ""bug"" or ""javascript-error,"" but since the label in question is ""runtime error,"" I need to assess its accuracy. The issue indeed describes an error happening during runtime, so the label seems appropriate.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem described.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" correctly identifies that a JavaScript error occurs during execution when a backslash is used in a repo topic.

起因：转存的天翼云分享的有声小说，文件众多，复制到其他盘（或者本地盘也是），读取天翼云盘里的文件时，会提示敏感词而不能读取，因此需要修改后才能读取。因为不同的有声书、文件众多，出问题的文件各不相同，在失败任务里面的位置非常分散，不方便处理。
是否可以增加以下功能：
1、失败任务(或者任务结果)按状态分类
2、失败任务(或者任务结果)可以点前面的文件名定位到目录里去（方便改名）
3、失败的任务(或者任务结果)按文件路径名排个序，方便处理同一目录的失败任务
4、失败任务(或者任务结果)能增加一个搜索功能


### Suggested solution / 实现思路

上一个版本已经实现复制任务在重启后不丢失，如果是用的sqlite存储的话，可以用数据库的排序方式，如果不是，可能需要别的方案

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""feature request"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied to resolve it.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Feature Request: Enhanced Task Management UI"". This clearly suggests that someone is asking for a new feature or an improvement in the user interface related to task management. So the label seems appropriate here because feature requests are about adding or enhancing functionalities.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It describes several changes made through patches, which include adding new components, modifying existing UI elements like tables and buttons, introducing name analyzers for tasks, and updating various files to implement these features. These changes seem to be substantial enhancements rather than simple bug fixes or minor tweaks. They add new functionalities and improve the user interface, which aligns with what a feature request typically encompasses.

Looking at the patches provided: 

- Patches 1 through 10 show significant additions and modifications across multiple files. For example, adding new components like `TaskNameAnalyzer`, enhancing the Tasks component with filtering, pagination, sorting, and expanding/collapsing features, updating UI elements to be more interactive (like clickable paths), and integrating these into existing pages. These changes are not just fixing issues but rather introducing new capabilities and improving user experience.

- The presence of UI/UX improvements, such as adding checkboxes, sortable columns, and expandable sections, further indicates that this is a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

Considering all these points, the label ""feature request"" accurately captures the nature of the issue. It's about adding new features and improving the existing user interface for better task management.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""feature request"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on its title and body.

Looking at the title: ""关于复制失败的后续处理"". Translating that, it's about subsequent processing after a copy failure. So the user is talking about handling failures in some process, likely related to copying files.

Now, moving to the body. The user starts with a checklist, which seems standard for feature requests—checking if they've read the docs, no duplicates, etc. Then, under ""Description of the feature / 需求描述"", they explain their problem: They're trying to copy many files from 天翼云 (China Telecom's cloud service) to another location, but some files fail due to sensitive words. The failures are scattered, making it hard to handle.

They then propose specific features:
1. Categorize failed tasks by status.
2. Click on filenames to locate them in the directory for easy renaming.
3. Sort failed tasks by file path to group similar ones together.
4. Add a search function for failed tasks.

In the ""Suggested solution"" section, they mention that if using SQLite, sorting can be done via the database; otherwise, alternative methods might be needed. This shows they're thinking about how it could be implemented.

The user is clearly asking for new functionalities to improve handling of copy failures. They aren't reporting a bug or an error but are suggesting enhancements to the existing feature set. Therefore, this fits well under a ""feature request"" label rather than something like ""bug"" or ""support"".

So yes, the label accurately reflects the issue.

go-gitea/gitea,33036,package management,Using '-' as separator between GroupID and ArtifactID (Maven) is a poor choice - not unique.,"### Description

Copied from discussion in [[30568](<URL> - originally  for a different issue and now closed with pending PR.

Gitea made a poor descision (IMHO) to use the separator '-' between groupID and artifactID.

Consider the following:

```The code snippet appears to be excerpts from an XML configuration file, likely a Maven `pom.xml`, defining two artifact entries with their respective group IDs, artifact IDs, and version numbers.```

Both result in the same URL:
packages/maven/foo-bar-jdbc/1-SNAPSHOT

Although a '-' in a groupID is not ""good-practice"", it is not forbidden and perfectly valid and in common use.

For example:

```This code snippet defines a Maven dependency for the `commons-lang` library from the WSO2 group ID, version `2.6.0.wso2v1`.```

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""package management"" is appropriate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's in the issue.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it says something about maven metadata and checksums. That immediately makes me think it's related to how Maven handles its dependencies and package metadata, which falls under package management.

Next, I read through the body of the issue. It seems like someone has made several patches or changes to a repository, possibly to fix issues related to Maven. They provided code snippets showing modifications in how files are handled, checksums are generated, and metadata is managed. All these terms—metadata, checksums, versions—are directly tied to package management systems, especially in the context of Java where Maven is commonly used.

The user then assigned a label ""package management"" to this issue report. My task is to determine if that's accurate based on the provided content. From what I can see, all the changes and discussions revolve around managing Maven packages, including how metadata is stored, versions are handled, and checksums are verified. These are core aspects of package management.

So, putting it all together, the label ""package management"" does indeed accurately reflect the nature of this issue report because it's dealing with the mechanics of handling and managing software packages using Maven.
</think>

The label ""package management"" is appropriate for this issue as it deals with the handling and management of Maven packages, including metadata and checksums. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""package management"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

The title of the issue is about using '-' as a separator between GroupID and ArtifactID in Maven, stating it's a poor choice because it's not unique. So, the main concern here is how Gitea handles Maven package coordinates, specifically the separator used which causes URL conflicts when different groups/artifacts produce the same URL.

Looking at the body, it explains that when you have two different sets of groupId and artifactId, they end up with the same URL because of the '-' separator. For example:
- groupId ""foo"" and artifactId ""bar-jdbc"" becomes packages/maven/foo-bar-jdbc/1-SNAPSHOT.
- groupId ""foo-bar"" and artifactId ""jdbc"" also becomes packages/maven/foo-bar-jdbc/1-SNAPSHOT.

This duplication is problematic because Maven allows '-' in groupIds, so it's a valid use case even if not common practice. The issue points out that Gitea's choice of separator isn't handling this correctly, leading to potential conflicts or incorrect package resolutions.

The user also provided an example dependency where the groupId has a '-', showing that it's a real-world scenario. They're asking for this to be fixed because it affects how packages are managed and accessed in Gitea.

Now, considering the label ""package management,"" I think it fits here. The issue is about how Maven packages are being handled by Gitea, specifically regarding their identifiers and URLs. It's related to managing package repositories, dependencies, and how they're stored or accessed.

So, yes, the label accurately reflects the problem described in the issue.

pytorch/pytorch,118862,bug,Using package Torch from CMake fails,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

When trying to use `find_package(Torch)` with a fresh, self-compiled version of PyTorch in CMake, the following errors are raised:

```The log indicates that CMake is unable to link libraries for the ""caffe2::mkl"" target because it is not being built as part of the current project. This error occurs during the configuration process when CMake tries to include necessary packages for building the project.```

The content of mkl.cmake is:
```This code snippet checks for the presence of the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) and sets up an imported target `caffe2::mkl` to link against MKL. It includes necessary directories and libraries, handles library directory links, and applies a workaround for architecture-dependent library paths.```

This probably (?) a bug that was introduced between PyTorch v2.0.1 and v2.2.0, as this problem did not happen for me for v2.0.1.

Below the configuration used by `python setup.py install` can be found. `BUILD_CAFFE2` and `BUILD_CAFFE2_OPS` are set to `OFF`.

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````The log shows the configuration and building process of PyTorch version 2.2.0a0+git8ac9b20. Key points include:

- The build is configured to use MKL for BLAS and MKLDNN for CPU acceleration.
- CUDA 11.7 and cuDNN 8.9.4 are used for GPU acceleration.
- The build includes support for AVX512 instructions.
- The build process uses Ninja as the build system.
- The build is configured to enable tests and Python bindings.
- The installation prefix is set to `/home/neuhauser/build/pytorch-new/torch`.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue isn't provided here, but the body includes a lot of technical details about building PyTorch from source using CMake and the subsequent environment setup. The user also shared some patches that were applied to resolve the problem they faced.

The patches show changes in how the project handles the MKL library integration. Before the patch, there was a condition checking if the target `caffe2::mkl` didn't exist, then adding it as an interface library. After the patch, this condition is inverted: if the target exists, it returns early; otherwise, it adds the library.

This suggests that without the patch, the build process might have been trying to add a target that already existed or wasn't properly handled, leading to some kind of error during compilation or configuration. This would typically be classified as a bug because it's an unintended behavior causing the build to fail or misbehave.

The label ""bug"" is appropriate here since the issue was resolved by correcting how the MKL library target was being added in CMake, which indicates that there was a flaw or mistake in the original code. The patches fixed this flaw, allowing the build to proceed successfully.
</think>

1",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue report. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The user included a bunch of logs from when they ran cmake and built PyTorch. They also shared their environment information, which includes PyTorch version 2.2.0a0+git8ac9b20, CUDA 11.7, OS Ubuntu 22.04, etc. Then there's the versions of various libraries they have installed.

Looking at the cmake output, it seems like everything compiled without major errors. I see that some tests failed—like HAS_WMISSING_PROTOTYPES and HAS_WERROR_MISSING_PROTOTYPES—but those are warnings or build configuration issues, not necessarily bugs in PyTorch itself. The build completed successfully, as indicated by ""Build files have been written to..."" and the subsequent cmake --build command.

The environment information shows that they're using a specific version of PyTorch from git, which might be a development or custom build. All their libraries seem up-to-date, including CUDA and cuDNN versions compatible with their setup.

There's no mention of any runtime errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior in PyTorch functionality. The user didn't describe any issues they encountered while using PyTorch after the build, so I don't see evidence of a bug here. It looks more like a successful build process with some non-critical warnings during compilation.

Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" might be incorrect because there's no indication that something is broken or not functioning as expected in PyTorch itself.
</think>

The label ""bug"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue report since the provided logs indicate a successful build without runtime errors. The failed tests are minor and don't signify a bug in PyTorch functionality.

Okay, let's see what I need to do here. I have an issue report with some code patches, and I'm supposed to determine if the label ""region"" accurately reflects the problem based on the provided information.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions a bug where restore operations are not correctly handling split regions. That immediately tells me that the problem is related to how regions are being managed during restores. Regions in TiKV are used for data distribution and splitting them can affect performance and data placement.

Now, diving into the patches provided:

Patch 10 shows modifications in the rewriteRawKey function, which seems related to handling key prefixes and rewriting them according to some rules. It adds a new function RewriteAndEncodeRawKey that replaces a part of the key with a new prefix. This might be part of how data is being read or rewritten during restore, possibly affecting region splits.

Patch 11 updates the Go library dependencies, adding ""//pkg/ddl"" which suggests that the fix involves changes related to DDL (Data Definition Language) operations. DDL often deals with schema changes, and in the context of TiKV, this could relate to how regions are split or merged based on table structures.

Patch 12 modifies import statements, bringing in ""sync/atomic"" and updating the runRestore function. The key part here is a change in the RestoreTables method call, where it now checks if ddl.EnableSplitTableRegion is set using atomic.LoadUint32. This indicates that the restore process is now considering whether to split regions based on some configuration. Previously, this might not have been handled correctly.

Patch 13 adjusts a test command line to include ""--merge-region-key-count 1"", which seems to be testing region merging behavior with a specific key count. This directly relates to how regions are managed during restore operations.

Putting it all together: the issue revolves around incorrect handling of region splits during restore. The patches modify functions related to key rewriting, DDL handling, and configuration checks for splitting regions. These changes ensure that regions are split correctly based on the appropriate configurations, addressing the bug reported.

The label ""region"" accurately captures the essence of this issue because it's all about how regions are managed—splitting, merging, or handling them during restore operations. Therefore, assigning the ""region"" label is correct.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""region"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""br restore splits too much regions if there are too many small tables whose data size is less than region size."" The issue mentions regions being split excessively during a restore operation. So the problem revolves around how regions are handled, specifically when restoring a backup.

Now, examining the body. It's a bug report where the user provides steps to reproduce the issue. They mention creating many small tables and using certain backup options (`split-table` and `split-region-on-table`). After restoring, they observe that the number of regions increases significantly instead of staying close to the original cluster's count.

The key points here are about region management during restore. The expected behavior is that the downstream cluster's regions should be similar in number to the upstream, but instead, many more regions are created. This indicates a problem with how regions are split or managed during the restore process.

Considering all this, the label ""region"" seems appropriate because the issue directly relates to region splitting and management in TiDB. The core of the problem is about regions being over-split, which falls under the category of region-related issues.

JuliaLang/julia,55008,bug,Error in comparing `getnameinfo` result in `Sockets` CI test,"Seen in <URL>

`````The log indicates that a test failure occurred in the Sockets module of Julia version 1.12.0-DEV.805 on a Windows platform. The specific test failed at line 226 of `runtests.jl` in the Sockets test suite, where the expected outcome was for `getnameinfo(ip""203.0.113.1"")` to equal `""203.0.113.1""`, but instead, it evaluated to `""customer1.example.com""`. This led to a test failure, resulting in an error message indicating that the test run had completed with errors.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue title says there's an error in comparing `getnameinfo` results in a Sockets CI test. The body includes an error message from a test failure where `getnameinfo(ip""203.0.113.1"")` was expected to return the IP string but instead returned ""customer1.example.com"". That means the function isn't behaving as intended, which sounds like a bug.

Looking at the patch provided, it skips the failing test by adding `@test_skip` and mentions it's temporarily broken due to a DNS issue. This indicates that there was indeed a problem in the code that needed fixing, so using the ""bug"" label makes sense because it points out where something went wrong.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but just focusing on whether ""bug"" fits. Since the test was failing because of unexpected behavior from `getnameinfo`, labeling this as a bug accurately reflects the problem.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Error in comparing `getnameinfo` result in `Sockets` CI test"". This immediately tells me that something went wrong during a test related to the Sockets module. The mention of an error suggests there's an unexpected behavior or failure.

Now, diving into the body of the issue. The user provided a detailed log from the Buildkite build. It shows an error in the testset for Sockets. Specifically, the test failed because `getnameinfo(ip""203.0.113.1"")` didn't return ""203.0.113.1"" as expected; instead, it returned ""customer1.example.com"". That's a clear discrepancy—what was supposed to be an IP address comparison resulted in a domain name string.

The error message is pretty straightforward: the test expected one value but got another. This indicates that there's likely a bug in either the `getnameinfo` function or how it's being used in the test. The fact that this happened in a CI environment suggests it's not just a local issue, making it more critical.

Furthermore, the body includes the Julia version and commit hash, which helps in identifying exactly where the problem might be. It also shows that the error caused the test run to fail, leading to a LoadError. The presence of a stack trace points to specific lines in the code where things went wrong, which is helpful for debugging.

The user ended the report by mentioning that they were instructed to submit a bug report, which further implies that this is indeed a bug rather than a feature request or another type of issue. They included all necessary details like environment variables and platform info, which are crucial for developers to diagnose the problem.

Considering all these points—the error in test results, unexpected behavior, and the comprehensive information provided—it's clear that this report is about an actual bug in the codebase. Therefore, labeling it as a ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue described.
</think>

The label ""bug"" appropriately reflects the issue as it describes an unexpected error in test results indicating a potential defect in the `getnameinfo` function.

denoland/deno,25045,logging,Enable `log` feature of `tracing` crate,"## Proposal

Enable the `tracing` crate's `log` feature in order to be able to inspect logs generated from some third party crates that use `tracing` for logging, such as `hyper`.

## Motivation

We use the `log` and `env_logger` for logging. So we can view logs by setting the `RUST_LOG` env var appropriately. We can even look at logs generated by third party crates that use `log` in the same way. However, some crates use `tracing` instead of `log`, and by default the `tracing` crate does not emit logs in a way that can be viewed with `env_logger`. To get the `tracing` mechanism to work well with the `log` ecosystem, we need to enable the `log` feature in the `tracing` crate.

<URL>

Note that although we don't directly use `tracing` in our code, the only way to enable the `log` feature in `tracing` as far as I searched is to add an explicit dependency on `tracing` in our `Cargo.toml` with the feature.

Ref: <URL>

## Benefits

As mentioned above, enabling the `log` feature will allow us to observe logs emitted from, for example, `hyper`. This would be really helpful for debugging purposes especially when a user runs into an issue that we can't reproduce locally but can be reproduced in their environment. In this case, we can ask the user to run the program with `RUST_LOG=trace` or something and send us the logs that we can then examine to figure out what was going wrong.

Let's take a quick example to illustrate the point. The program to run is:

```The code snippet is an asynchronous fetch request to a URL using `await`.```

In Deno v1.45.5 with `RUST_LOG=h2=debug`, we see no output:

```The code snippet sets the Rust log level to debug for the h2 module and then uses Deno to evaluate a JavaScript expression that performs an HTTP request using the `fetch` API.```

But if we enable the `log` feature, the output is like this:

```The log shows the HTTP/2 client connection process initiated by Deno. It includes the following key events:

- Binding and confirming the client connection.
- Sending initial settings and window update frames.
- Sending a request with headers and receiving corresponding settings and window updates from the server.
- Receiving data from the server.
- Closing the connection with a GoAway frame indicating no error.```

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""logging"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the applied patches.

First, let's look at the issue title: ""Enable `log` feature of `tracing` crate."" This suggests that the problem is about enabling a logging feature in the tracing crate. The goal here seems to be integrating tracing logs with the existing logging system.

The body explains that they're using `log` and `env_logger`, which are standard Rust logging tools. However, some third-party crates like `hyper` use `tracing` for logging instead of `log`. By default, `tracing` doesn't emit logs in a way that's compatible with `env_logger`. Enabling the `log` feature in `tracing` would allow these logs to be captured by their existing setup. This makes debugging easier because they can ask users to provide logs using `RUST_LOG`.

The patches provided show adding `tracing` as a dependency and enabling the `log` feature. They also add filters for specific modules, like suppressing certain verbose logs from other crates. These changes are all about integrating and managing logging behavior.

The label assigned is ""logging."" Since the issue revolves around enhancing how logs from third-party crates are captured using `tracing` with the `log` feature, it fits perfectly under the logging category. The patches modify dependencies and logging configurations to achieve this integration, which directly relates to logging functionality.

So, yes, the label accurately reflects the issue's purpose.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""logging"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by reading through the title and body carefully.

The title is ""Enable `log` feature of `tracing` crate."" This immediately tells me that the issue is about enabling a specific feature in the tracing crate related to logging. The word ""log"" here is key, suggesting it's about integrating or enabling logging functionality.

Moving on to the body, there's a proposal section explaining that they want to enable the `log` feature of the `tracing` crate. The motivation provided is about using `log` and `env_logger` for logging in their project. They mention that third-party crates like `hyper` use `tracing` instead of `log`, and without enabling this feature, those logs aren't visible via `env_logger`. Enabling it would allow them to inspect these third-party logs more effectively.

The benefits section further elaborates on how this will help with debugging by allowing users to provide logs when issues occur. They even give an example where enabling the log feature produces detailed debug output that wasn't present before, showing how useful this is for troubleshooting.

Looking at the label assigned, it's ""logging."" Considering all the points above—the focus on enabling a logging feature, integrating with existing logging tools like `env_logger`, and the examples provided that show logs being captured—it definitely seems relevant. The issue revolves around enhancing or properly configuring logging within their project setup to include traces from dependencies.

I don't see any aspects of this issue that would fall outside the scope of ""logging."" It's not about performance, security, or other features; it's squarely about improving how logging works with third-party crates using `tracing`.

So yes, the label ""logging"" accurately reflects the content and purpose of this issue.
</think>

The label ""logging"" is appropriate because the issue focuses on enabling a logging feature to integrate third-party crate logs into the existing logging system.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Add sdpa choice for DeviceType::PrivateUse1"". This suggests they're adding a new feature or functionality, which aligns with an enhancement.

Next, the body of the issue explains that they want to extend PyTorch's support for DeviceType::PrivateUse1 by adding sdpa. They provided code snippets showing where changes are needed, specifically in handling different device types. This indicates they're introducing a new option or capability, which is typically what an enhancement entails.

Then, examining the patches applied. The first patch adds a new function `handle_private_use` that seems to handle the PrivateUse1 device type by calling `_fused_sdp_choice_stub`. In the second part of the patch, they modify the conditional statement to include DeviceType::PrivateUse1 and call this new function if that device is detected.

So, the patches are adding support for a new device type in an existing feature. Enhancements usually involve adding new functionalities or improving existing ones without fixing bugs. There's no indication here of a bug fix; instead, it's about extending the supported devices.

Therefore, the label ""enhancement"" fits because they're enhancing the code by adding support for another device type.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as an enhancement since it adds new functionality.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""enhancement"" is correct for this GitHub issue report. Let me break down what's in the title and body.

The title says, ""Add sdpa choice for DeviceType::PrivateUse1."" That sounds like a feature request because it's asking to add something new. The body explains that they want to extend PyTorch support for DeviceType::PrivateUse1 by adding an option for sdpa. They even provided some code snippets showing where the change is needed, which looks like they're modifying existing conditional checks to include this new device type.

Looking at the current labels, ""enhancement"" seems appropriate because it's about adding a new feature or improving functionality. There's no mention of a bug fix or anything breaking, so ""bug"" doesn't apply. It's not a question either; they’re making a clear request for an addition. So yeah, I think the label fits.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43070,runtime error,Root cause of errors is hidden when loading images from archive ,Forward port of issue #43069 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Root cause of errors is hidden when loading images from archive."" This suggests that there's a problem where errors aren't being properly exposed or logged when trying to load images from an archive. So, the main issue here seems to be about error handling and visibility.

The body of the issue is pretty short; it just mentions a forward port of another issue (#43069) to version 3.4.x. That doesn't give me much detail, but I can assume that this is a known problem that's being addressed in a newer branch.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 shows changes in the load method. They replaced StreamCaptureUpdateListener with LoadImageUpdateListener and added an assertion to check for valid responses. This indicates they're improving how errors are captured and handled during image loading.

Patch 2 modifies the LoadImageUpdateEvent class by adding an ErrorDetail field, including a new constructor and getters. This means they're now capturing more detailed error information in the event, which helps in identifying what went wrong.

Patch 3 adds a new test case (loadWithErrorResponseThrowsException) that checks if an exception is thrown when an error response is received. This test ensures that the system correctly handles error scenarios by throwing appropriate exceptions with meaningful messages.

Patch 4 updates the test class to include a test for the ErrorDetail message, ensuring that when an event has an error detail, it's correctly retrieved and asserted. It also creates a sample JSON file (load-error.json) which likely contains an error message used in testing.

Putting this all together, the problem was that errors during image loading weren't being properly reported, making it hard to diagnose issues. The patches add better error handling by capturing detailed error information and ensuring that these errors are correctly thrown and tested.

So, does the label ""runtime error"" fit here? A runtime error typically refers to an exception or error that occurs during the execution of the program, as opposed to compile-time errors. In this case, the issue is about improving how runtime errors (specifically those occurring when loading images) are handled and reported. The patches enhance error visibility, which directly relates to runtime behavior.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" seems appropriate because it accurately describes that the issue pertains to errors occurring during the execution of the program when loading images from an archive.
</think>

1",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""Root cause of errors is hidden when loading images from archive."" From this, it sounds like there's a problem where errors aren't being shown clearly when trying to load images from an archive. The body just mentions that it's a forward port of another issue, specifically #43069, to the 3.4.x branch.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error,"" I know that runtime errors occur during the execution of the program and typically cause it to crash or behave unexpectedly. They are usually related to issues that weren't caught at compile time.

Looking back at the issue title, the problem is about the root cause of errors being hidden. This suggests that when loading images from an archive, any errors that occur don't show their actual causes, making debugging harder. However, this doesn't explicitly state that a runtime error happens—it's more about the visibility or reporting of errors rather than the occurrence of a crash or unexpected behavior.

The body doesn't add much detail; it just references another issue. Without additional context from the linked issue #43069, I can only go by what's provided here. The main point is that errors are hidden, not necessarily that a runtime error occurs.

So, while the problem might lead to runtime issues or could be related, the label ""runtime error"" doesn't exactly capture the essence of the problem described. It's more about error reporting than an actual runtime error.

Support the risczero platfrom by riscv32-unknown-elf-g++. which will bring more prove system for bitcoin.


### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.

when i compile by riscv32-unknown-elf-g++ compiler, get the below error:

```The log indicates a warning and an error during the compilation process using Cargo. The error occurs when trying to serialize an `int` object using the `Serialize` function from the `serialize.h` header file. Specifically, the error message suggests that the `Serialize` member function is being called on a `const int` object, which is not valid. This issue arises through a chain of include files and function calls starting from `hash.h`, `interpreter.h`, `interpreter.cpp`, and ultimately `serialize.h`.```

This error is caused by the logic in the SignatureHash function within src/script/interpreter.cpp. The function serializes the data to obtain a hash value, but it fails to find a serialization method for the int type.

```The code snippet appends `nHashType` to `ss`.```
This behavior is particularly strict in environments like RISC-V, where the ABI (Application Binary Interface) might enforce more rigid type distinctions, leading to errors during compilation.

The `-march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32` for the compiler(riscv32-unknown-elf-g++).

### Describe the solution you'd like

This issue was temporarily bypassed by adding serialization/deserialization code for the int type. Supporting R0 will allow the BTC L2 prover to extend to more proof systems.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down what's in the issue and the solution patches.

The title is ""Risczero Fit"", which probably refers to support for RISC-V architecture, specifically riscv32-unknown-elf-g++. The body describes a feature request where compiling with this compiler results in an error related to serialization of an int type. The user provided the specific error message from the build process.

Looking at the patches, I see two changes:
1. In CTransactionSignatureSerializer, `int{0}` is changed to `int32_t{0}`.
2. The function SignatureHash has its parameter nHashType changed from `int` to `int32_t`.

So both changes are about type definitions in the code. The problem arises during compilation because of type mismatches or incorrect serialization methods for certain types, which caused the compiler to throw an error.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". I think this makes sense because the issue was triggered by the compiler (specifically when using riscv32-unknown-elf-g++), and the solution involved changing variable types to make the code compatible with that compiler. The problem wasn't about a bug in the functionality but rather about the build process failing due to type issues.

Therefore, the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue report.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by carefully reading through both the title and the body of the issue.

The title is ""Risczero Fit"". Hmm, that's a bit cryptic. It might be referring to compatibility with RISC-V architecture or something similar. Not entirely clear yet, but let's move on to the body for more context.

In the body, the user describes a feature request to support the risczero platform using the riscv32-unknown-elf-g++ compiler. They mention that this will bring more proof systems for Bitcoin. So the main goal here is adding support for a specific compiler targeting RISC-V.

Next, they explain the problem they encountered when compiling with that compiler. The error messages indicate issues in the code related to serialization of integer types. Specifically, the compiler throws an error because it can't find a Serialize method for 'int'. This happens during the instantiation of a template function, which suggests a type handling issue.

Looking deeper, the error occurs in the SignatureHash function within interpreter.cpp. The user points out that the function tries to serialize data but fails for integers. They mention that this is particularly problematic on RISC-V environments where the ABI is stricter about types.

The solution they propose involves adding serialization/deserialization methods for int types. They also reference a PR that adds these methods, suggesting that's a possible fix. The user believes supporting R0 (maybe referring to RISC-V) would help extend Bitcoin's L2 prover to more systems.

Now, considering the labels: the assigned label is ""compiler"". I need to see if this accurately represents the issue.

The issue revolves around a compilation error when using a specific compiler for RISC-V. The problem arises from type serialization in the code not being compatible with how the RISC-V ABI handles integers. This means it's an issue related to compiling the code with that particular toolchain, so ""compiler"" seems appropriate.

However, another aspect is that the root cause is in the code's handling of certain data types during serialization, which could also be labeled as a ""bug"" or ""build issue"". But since the problem manifests when using the compiler and the solution involves changes to accommodate the compiler's requirements, ""compiler"" fits well.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but considering the context, ""compiler"" accurately captures the essence of the problem because it's specifically about compilation errors with a particular toolchain.
</think>

The label ""compiler"" is appropriate for this issue as it directly pertains to compilation problems encountered when using a specific compiler (riscv32-unknown-elf-g++) on RISC-V architecture. The error arises from type handling during serialization, which is a build/compilation issue.

As an aside, when is the special argument for `:help shellescape()` needed?  ",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""shellescaping of :! versus :term"". This suggests that the problem is about how shellescape is handled differently between two commands in Vim, namely `:!cmd` and `:term cmd`. The user is asking about whether this behavior is properly documented in the help files for these commands.

The body of the issue reinforces this. It mentions that when a file path is passed to `:!cmd`, shellescape is needed, whereas with `:term cmd path`, it's not. The user is specifically asking how this is documented in the respective help sections (`:help :!` and `:help :term`). They also have an aside about when shellescape() is needed, which again points towards documentation.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 seems to modify some internal files, adding new entries like term++shell and terminal-nospecial. This suggests that the help documentation for these features is being updated or added.

Patch 2 adds a section in terminal.txt explaining how Vim handles commands when using `:term ++shell`. It details that Vim itself doesn't process special characters except as noted, and refers to using the term++shell option, which relates directly to how shellescape might be handled. Additionally, it updates the help documentation for `:term` with more detailed explanations.

Patch 3 modifies various.txt, specifically the section about `:!{cmd}`. It explains in detail how Vim constructs the command line, considering options like 'shell', 'shcf', 'sxq', and 'shq'. It also notes that all cmdline-special characters are replaced before passing to the shell, which ties into shellescape handling.

Putting this together, the issue is about ensuring proper documentation of how shellescaping works in different commands. The patches add new sections and clarify existing ones in the help files. Therefore, the label ""documentation"" fits because the changes address documenting these behaviors rather than fixing a bug or introducing a new feature.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to documenting command behavior.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. 

The issue's title is about ""shellescaping of :! versus :term."" So it's comparing how two different Vim commands handle escaping file paths when executing shell commands. The body goes into more detail, asking whether shellescape(path) is needed for :!cmd but not for :term cmd path. It also questions the documentation in :help :! and :help :term, wondering if this behavior is properly documented.

The user then adds an aside about when shellescape() is necessary. So they're seeking clarification or better documentation on these commands' escaping requirements.

Looking at the label assigned—""documentation""—it seems spot-on because the issue revolves around whether Vim's help documentation accurately covers these specific behaviors of :! and :term regarding shell escaping. The user isn't reporting a bug or requesting a feature; instead, they're pointing out potential gaps in the existing documentation that need clarification or improvement.

Therefore, yes, ""documentation"" is an accurate label for this issue.
</think>

The label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the issue as it concerns the adequacy and clarity of Vim's help documentation regarding shell escaping in specific commands.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40122,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Gradle Enterprise Conventions 0.0.16,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Gradle Enterprise Conventions 0.0.16"". This clearly indicates that the purpose is to update a dependency, specifically moving from version 0.0.16-SNAPSHOT to 0.0.16. The mention of ""upgrade"" in the title already points towards a version change.

Next, examining the body of the issue: it's empty. There's no additional description provided beyond the title. However, since the patches are included, I can infer that the main action was changing the dependency version without any extra context or explanation needed.

Now, looking at the patch provided. It shows a change in the build.gradle file where the plugin version for ""io.spring.ge.conventions"" is updated from 0.0.16-SNAPSHOT to 0.0.16. This directly points to an upgrade of a dependency. The SNAPSHOT version typically denotes a development or unstable release, so moving to a non-SNAPSHOT version likely means it's now stable.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Considering the title explicitly mentions an upgrade and the patch shows a version update, this label fits perfectly. There's no indication that this change was for a new feature, bug fix, or any other type of issue. It solely focuses on updating a dependency to a newer version.

Therefore, after evaluating all parts—the title, body, and patches—it's clear that ""dependency upgrade"" is the correct label for this issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. The issue's title is ""Upgrade to Gradle Enterprise Conventions 0.0.16"", and the body is empty.

First, let me break down what each part means. The title mentions upgrading to a specific version of Gradle Enterprise Conventions. Gradle is a build tool for Java and other languages, and conventions usually refer to predefined configurations or plugins that streamline the build process.

The term ""upgrade"" in this context suggests moving from an older version to this newer one, 0.0.16. So, this issue is about updating a dependency in the project, specifically the Gradle Enterprise Conventions plugin.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""dependency upgrade"". This label is typically used when the issue pertains to updating libraries or tools that the project depends on. Since the title clearly states an upgrade to a specific version of a Gradle convention, it fits well under dependency management.

The body being empty doesn't provide additional context, but the title alone is sufficient here. There's no mention of new features, bugs, or other types of issues, so it's straightforward.

I don't see any reasons why this label wouldn't be accurate. The issue is solely about upgrading a dependency, which aligns perfectly with ""dependency upgrade"".

On Android, v3.1.6",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ui"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Blank screen when searching for a note and switching phone off and on again."" This suggests that after performing certain actions, the app displays a blank screen instead of the expected content. That sounds like a UI-related problem because the user interface isn't rendering correctly.

Next, reading the body of the issue, it describes a series of steps leading to the blank screen. The user searches for a note, opens it, turns their phone off and on, and ends up with a blank screen. Additionally, when they try editing and attaching an image, the same problem occurs—blank screen and unattached image. These are all issues related to how the app's interface is behaving under specific conditions, which points towards a UI bug.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

Patch 1 modifies the NotesScreenComponent by adding lines that prevent certain refresh actions if the parent type is 'Search'. This seems to be addressing how the component handles state changes, particularly related to searching. Since the problem occurs during search and navigation, this patch is tweaking UI-related behavior.

Patch 2 updates the appReducer to set the notesParentType when navigating to a specific route ('Search') and adds logging for debugging. This indicates that the issue was related to how the app's state manages different views or routes, which directly affects the user interface when switching between screens like the Search screen.

Putting this all together: The problem is about unexpected UI behavior (blank screen) under certain user actions and navigation. The patches address state management in components and reducers tied to search functionality and route navigation, both of which are integral parts of the user interface.

So, the label ""ui"" accurately reflects that the issue pertains to the app's interface not displaying content correctly. Therefore, I agree with assigning this label.
</think>

The issue revolves around unexpected UI behavior (blank screen) triggered by specific actions and navigation. Patches addressed state management in components affecting search functionality and route navigation, which are part of the UI. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ui"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem description carefully.

The title says there's a blank screen when searching for a note and switching the phone off and on again. That immediately makes me think something's wrong with how the app displays things, maybe related to the user interface since it's about what's showing up (or not) on the screen.

Looking at the body, the issue happens in two scenarios. First, when searching for a note, opening it, then switching off and on again, which results in a blank screen with just a header and a back arrow. That definitely sounds like a UI problem because the app isn't rendering correctly after those actions. The second scenario involves editing a note, attaching an image, and getting the same blank screen without the image being attached. Again, this seems related to how the UI handles transitions or state changes after certain user interactions.

The label ""ui"" typically refers to issues that affect the visual elements or the user interface of an application. Since both scenarios involve unexpected behavior in what's displayed on the screen—like a blank page where content should be—it makes sense that this is a UI-related problem.

I don't see any mention of crashes, performance issues, or backend errors, which might point to other labels like ""bug"" or ""performance."" It's specifically about how the app looks and behaves after certain actions, so ""ui"" seems accurate here.
</think>

The label ""ui"" accurately reflects this issue as it pertains to unexpected visual behavior.

rust-lang/rust,126012,metadata,Missing optimized MIR for an item,"`````````The code snippet demonstrates two Rust files, `a.rs` and `b.rs`, where `a.rs` defines a static function pointer `A` that points to another function `f`, which is marked with `#[inline(never)]`. The function `f` is then used within a closure that returns a reference to itself. `b.rs` attempts to use the `A` static from `a.rs` in its `main` function. When compiling `b.rs` with `a.rs` as an external crate, it encounters an error indicating that optimized MIR (Intermediate Representation) is missing for an item in the `a` crate, suggesting that `a.rs` was not compiled with the `--emit=metadata` flag.```

@rustbot modify labels: +regression-from-stable-to-stable -regression-untriaged",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""metadata"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the problem described in the issue.

The title is ""Missing optimized MIR for an item."" The body includes some Rust code examples and error messages when compiling. From what I remember, MIR stands for Mid-level Intermediate Representation in Rust, which is part of the compiler's optimization process. So, if there's a missing optimized MIR, it suggests that the compiler isn't generating the necessary optimizations, leading to errors.

Looking at the console output, the error mentions ""missing optimized MIR for an item in the crate `a`."" The note suggests checking if the crate was compiled with `--emit=metadata`. That flag is related to emitting metadata, which is used for things like incremental compilation and other compiler optimizations. So, maybe the issue is about how the metadata is handled when compiling crates.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue. Patch 1 modifies some code in ReachableContext, adding a condition where if an expression is a closure, it's considered reachable. This seems to affect how certain closures are processed by the compiler, perhaps ensuring their MIR is generated correctly.

Patch 2 adds a new static variable K with similar structure to A, involving inline attributes on functions and closures. This might be testing or fixing cases where inlined closures were causing issues with MIR generation.

Patch 3 updates some static variables and includes the new K variable in main() calls, which again seems like it's testing whether the MIR for these items is correctly handled after the fix.

Putting this together, the issue was that certain items (like functions or closures) weren't having their optimized MIR generated when they should have been. The error message points to metadata emission as a potential cause, implying that without the right metadata, the compiler couldn't find the necessary MIR information.

The label assigned is ""metadata."" Does this make sense? Well, the problem revolves around whether the crate was compiled with `--emit=metadata` and whether the MIR for certain items was missing because of it. The patches seem to adjust how closures are marked as reachable, which affects metadata emission, thus ensuring that optimized MIRs are generated.

Therefore, the ""metadata"" label accurately reflects the issue because the problem is tied to how metadata is emitted during compilation, affecting the availability of optimized MIR for certain items.
</think>

The label ""metadata"" accurately captures the essence of the issue, which relates to the emission of metadata affecting MIR generation. 

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""metadata"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me look at the details provided.

The issue's title is ""Missing optimized MIR for an item."" MIR stands for Mid-level Intermediate Representation in Rust. It's part of the compiler's intermediate steps before generating machine code. The error message mentions a missing optimized MIR, which suggests something went wrong during compilation, possibly related to how the compiler handles optimizations or intermediate representations.

Looking at the body, there are some Rust code snippets and compilation commands. When compiling b.rs, it references crate `a`, and an error occurs about missing optimized MIR in `a`. The note suggests checking if `a` was compiled with `--emit=metadata`, which relates to whether metadata (like MIR) was emitted during the build.

The user also mentions a regression tied to a specific commit and adds labels related to it being a regression. However, the assigned label is ""metadata."" 

I think the error is about the absence of optimized MIR in the compiled crate, which ties into how metadata (including intermediate representations like MIR) is handled during compilation. So yes, the issue revolves around problems with emitting or using metadata correctly.

Therefore, labeling it as ""metadata"" seems appropriate because the core problem relates to missing intermediate compiler outputs needed for proper function.
</think>

The label ""metadata"" accurately reflects the issue because the error pertains to missing MIR in the compiled crate, which is part of the compiler's metadata.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40124,configuration,Make it harder to misconfigure logging.threshold.console in yaml,"This was found using Spring Boot 3.2.4 and Java 21.  Seems related to #36741.  

### Steps to reproduce
1. Build jar for any Spring Boot app that is using the default logging setup - i.e. spring-boot-starter-logging with no logback.xml or other config files, just `logging.*` properties set in application.yml.
2. Set `logging.threshold.console` to ""off"" in application.yml or application-{profile}.yml:
```The YAML snippet sets the logging threshold for the console to ""off"".```
3. Run app: `java -jar path/to/app.jar`

### Expected result
Only Spring banner printed to console, all logging goes to log file (if configured).

### Actual result
All logging appears on console.

### Observations
Running the app with this command instead produces expected result, with or without the same set in application.yml:
`java -Dlogging.threshold.console=off -jar path/to/app.jar`

Not sure if this could be relevant, but I noticed that the `start()` method is called directly on the `ThresholdFilter`, rather than using `config.start(filter)`:
<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Make it harder to misconfigure logging.threshold.console in yaml"". This suggests that the issue is about how configuration settings are handled, specifically related to YAML configuration files. The title mentions a specific configuration property (logging.threshold.console) which indicates that this is a configuration-related problem.

Next, the body of the issue describes steps to reproduce the problem involving setting a particular value in application.yml and observing unexpected behavior. It also references another issue (#36741), which might be related but doesn't change the fact that this issue is about configuration settings not behaving as expected. The user provided an example YAML snippet, which again points to configuration.

The actual result is that logging appears on the console even when it's supposed to be turned off. They also mention a workaround using a system property instead of the YAML setting, implying that the problem lies in how configurations are being processed. The observation about the ThresholdFilter method suggests a code issue, but the context remains within configuration handling.

Looking at the patches applied: Patch 1 modifies how system properties related to logging thresholds are set by introducing a mapper function (thresholdMapper). This function converts ""false"" to ""OFF"", which directly affects how the YAML configurations are interpreted. The test cases in Patch 2 also focus on ensuring that setting ""false"" for console or file thresholds correctly maps to ""OFF"".

So, both patches are about handling configuration properties correctly and ensuring that the system behaves as expected when certain values are set in YAML files.

The label ""configuration"" accurately reflects that this issue is about how logging configurations are processed, particularly the YAML settings. The problem was due to improper handling of configuration values, and the solution involved modifying how these configurations map to internal system properties.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Make it harder to misconfigure logging.threshold.console in yaml"". The title suggests that there's an issue with how the configuration for logging is set up. It mentions YAML specifically, which is a common format for configuration files. So the problem seems related to how configurations are handled or applied.

Now, reading through the body of the issue. The user explains steps to reproduce the problem involving setting `logging.threshold.console` in application.yml. They noticed that when they set it to ""off"" via YAML, logging still appears on the console, which isn't the intended behavior. However, using a command-line argument `-Dlogging.threshold.console=off` works as expected.

The user also points out some code in DefaultLogbackConfiguration.java where `start()` is called directly on ThresholdFilter instead of using `config.start(filter)`. This indicates that the issue might be about how configurations are applied or processed within the logging setup, possibly a bug in configuration handling.

So the problem revolves around the configuration of logging thresholds and how certain settings aren't being applied correctly when set via YAML. It's about misconfiguration possibilities and ensuring that the configuration behaves as intended without causing unexpected logging behavior.

The label ""configuration"" seems to fit because the issue is about the setup and application of logging configurations, specifically in YAML files, and how they might be leading to incorrect behaviors or allowing for easy misconfigurations.

Long lines in `TEST RESULTS` panel are not wrapped automatically. User need to resize the panel for it to happen:

<URL>

Line should be wrapped automatically like it happens for console output.
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""ui"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me read through the title and body of the issue report to understand what it's about. The title says, ""In `TEST RESULTS` panel, long lines are not automatically wrapped."" That makes sense—it seems like a problem with how text is displayed in the Test Results panel. Specifically, when there are long lines, they don't wrap on their own, which can be annoying for users because it requires resizing the panel manually.

Looking at the body, the user mentions that without an extension, they're not sure how to generate test results, but they've provided a screenshot link. They also compare this behavior to the console output, where lines do wrap automatically. So their point is that the Test Results panel should behave similarly.

Now, let's look at the patches made to resolve this issue. The code changes are in a file related to the TestResultsViewContent class. It looks like they're adjusting how the layout is handled. Before, there was a check on dimension and setting topFrame.height based on provider.layout with just the dimension. Now, they added a width parameter that's retrieved from SubView.Diff, and they pass both width and height (from this.dimension?.height) to the provider.layout method.

This seems like it's adjusting how the layout is calculated for the Test Results panel, ensuring that when the width changes, the content wraps correctly. So, it's about improving the user interface by making text wrap automatically without needing manual resizing.

The label assigned here was ""ui"". I think UI issues generally relate to the visual elements and user interactions within the application. Since this problem is about how text appears in a panel and how it wraps, which affects the user experience directly, labeling it as ""ui"" makes sense. It's not a bug in the functionality but rather in the presentation.

I don't see any other more specific labels mentioned here, like ""ux"" or ""layout"", so ""ui"" seems appropriate because it's about the interface's behavior regarding text wrapping.
</think>

The label ""ui"" accurately reflects the issue since it pertains to the user interface's text wrapping functionality in the Test Results panel. The changes made affect how the UI handles layout and display, directly impacting user experience.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""ui"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the issue details carefully.

The title is: ""In `TEST RESULTS` panel, long lines are not automatically wrapped."" So the problem is about how text behaves in a specific panel within VS Code. The body elaborates that when there are long lines in the TEST RESULTS panel, they don't wrap automatically, forcing users to resize the panel manually. There's also a mention of how console output does wrap lines correctly, which suggests the issue is about inconsistent UI behavior.

Looking at the labels assigned, it's ""ui"". The question is whether this label fits the problem described. 

The TEST RESULTS panel is part of the VS Code interface, so any issues with its display or layout fall under the UI category. Since the problem is about text wrapping not happening automatically, which affects how information is presented to the user, it relates directly to the user interface.

I don't see any technical aspects here that would suggest a different label like ""bug"" or ""performance"". It's specifically about how elements are displayed in the UI. Therefore, the label ""ui"" seems appropriate for this issue.
</think>

The label ""ui"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to the display and layout of text within the TEST RESULTS panel, which falls under user interface concerns.

At present when syncing a profile, Settings gets snapshot of each profile storage from main and discards the snapshot as soon as the sync is finished. On an average, settings sync syncs all profiles once per 5 minutes. This means, every 5 minutes settings sync reads all profiles storages from main. 

Ref: <URL>

Instead

- get profile storage from main when needed for the first time
- from there on sync the storage from main using listeners - incrementally update the profile storage
",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""settings"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Shared process should have a clone of all profile storages."" This suggests that the problem is about how profile storages are handled in a shared process environment. The term ""profile storages"" likely refers to where user profiles are stored and managed.

Now, the body of the issue explains that currently, when syncing a profile, the settings take snapshots from the main storage and discard them after sync. This happens every 5 minutes, which is inefficient because it reads all profiles each time. The proposed solution is to get the profile storage on first need and then use listeners for incremental updates. So, this seems related to how user data profiles are synced and managed across processes.

The patches provided are a bit technical, but I can see that they involve changing imports from NativeUserDataProfileStorageService to SharedProcessUserDataProfileStorageService. This indicates a shift towards using a shared process approach for handling profile storages. There's also modification in the constructors, adding parameters like persistStorages and managing storage services with DisposableMap. The code changes aim at reusing existing storage instances instead of creating new ones each time, which aligns with the problem described.

The label assigned is ""settings."" I need to determine if this label captures the essence of the issue. Settings usually refer to user preferences or application configurations. While profile storages might include settings, the issue seems broader—it's about the underlying storage mechanism for profiles, not just the settings themselves. The problem affects how data is synced and stored across shared processes, which could impact multiple aspects beyond just user settings.

Moreover, looking at the patches, they modify services related to user data profiles and storage management. These changes are more foundational, dealing with how storages are initialized, managed, and disposed of. They don't specifically target settings but rather the infrastructure supporting profile data synchronization.

Therefore, while ""settings"" might be a related area, it doesn't fully encapsulate the issue's focus on shared process handling of all profile storages. A more accurate label might be something like ""performance,"" ""architecture,"" or ""sync,"" as these better reflect the nature of the changes made.
</think>

The label ""settings"" does not accurately reflect this issue report because the problem and patches address broader storage management in a shared process environment, not just user settings.

0",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""settings"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Shared process should have a clone of all profile storages."" The term ""profile storages"" suggests it's related to how user profiles are managed. Since VSCode has settings that can be synced across different instances or devices, this seems connected to the settings feature.

Now, examining the body. It mentions syncing profiles and references an issue from microsoft/vscode where the problem was discovered. The current behavior described is about taking snapshots of profile storages and discarding them after sync. They propose a change in how these storages are handled—accessing when needed and using listeners for incremental updates.

The reference link points to a file named userDataProfileStorageService.ts, which is part of the user data profile system. This system is likely tied to settings synchronization because profiles often include user preferences and configurations, which fall under settings.

The label ""settings"" seems appropriate because the issue revolves around how profile storages (which contain user settings) are managed during syncing. The proposed solution aims to improve the efficiency and method of handling these settings, making the label relevant.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""backup"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patch used to fix it.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""nightly br always occurs oom where restore 1M tables."" The term ""br"" is commonly associated with backup and restore operations in TiDB. So the title suggests an OOM (out-of-memory) issue during a restore process involving a large number of tables.

In the body, the user describes using a command line that starts with `tiup br:nightly`, which I know is related to TiDB's backup and restore tool. The context mentions 100,000 databases and over 1 million tables, indicating a stress test scenario. The error log shows an OOM event where the process (br) was killed due to memory constraints.

The patch provided modifies how incomplete ranges are fetched in the code. Specifically, it changes the initial capacity of a slice from `64*len(iter.items)` to just `len(iter.items)`, with a comment indicating that this reduces memory usage for a million ranges. This suggests that the issue was related to memory management during backup or restore operations.

Putting it all together: the problem occurs in the backup/restore process (br), specifically causing an OOM situation when handling a large number of tables. The patch addresses this by optimizing memory allocation, which directly ties into the backup and restore functionality.

Therefore, the label ""backup"" is appropriate because the issue is about a problem occurring during a backup or restore operation.
</think>

The label ""backup"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to an out-of-memory error during a restore process using TiDB's backup tool (br). The patches address memory management in this context, confirming the relevance of the label.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""backup"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by reading through the title and body carefully.

The title says: ""nightly br always occurs oom where restore 1M tables."" Okay, so BR stands for Backup & Restore in TiDB, a popular open-source database. The user is experiencing an out-of-memory (OOM) issue during a nightly backup operation when restoring a large number of tables—specifically over 1 million.

Looking at the body, they provide details about their cluster setup: 3 TiDB nodes with 16 cores each, 3 TiKV nodes also with 16 cores, and 1 PD node. They mention having 100 thousand databases and more than 1M tables. The command line shows they're using `tiup br:nightly backup full`, which confirms it's a backup operation.

They encountered an OOM error while running this command. The log snippet shows the process being killed because it ran out of memory, with specific details about memory usage and the process ID. There's also a Git commit hash provided, which is useful for tracking the issue in the codebase.

Now, considering the label assigned was ""backup."" Since the problem revolves around the BR tool during a backup operation leading to an OOM error, it makes sense that the primary topic here is related to backups. The user is experiencing issues with the backup process, so labeling it under ""backup"" accurately categorizes the issue for others to find and reference.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but even if there were, ""backup"" seems directly relevant. There's no indication that this is about something else like performance or a different component unless more context suggests otherwise. The focus is on the backup process failing due to memory constraints, so ""backup"" is an appropriate label.

rust-lang/rust,130853,runtime error,Miscompile in the GVN transform,"

I tried this code:

```The code snippet defines an `unsafe` function `src` that dereferences a double pointer to check if the value remains unchanged after calling another `unsafe` function `unknown`. The `unknown` function sets a mutable static pointer to 1. In `main`, it prints the result of `src` by setting `SUSSY` to point to a mutable integer `s` and passing a reference to it to `src`.```

I expected to see this happen:

This should print `false`, as I believe this is DB under both Stacked and Tree borrows(according to MIRI).

Instead, this happened:

It returns `false` in Debug mode, and the GVN MIR pass makes `src()` unconditionally return `true` in Release mode.

```````The log shows that the `cargo miri run` command was executed to compile and run the `sus` project. The compilation was successful and produced a debuggable binary. The Miri runtime environment then executed the program, which returned `false`.```

```````The log shows that the `cargo` command was used to run the Rust project named `sus`. The compilation was successful and produced a release build optimized for performance. The build process took 0.31 seconds. After running the executable, the output was `true`.```

### Meta


Here's the MIR before the GVN pass:

`````The code snippet is a middle-end representation (MIR) of a Rust function named `src`, which takes a reference to a reference of an unsigned 8-bit integer (`&&u8`) and returns a boolean. The function performs the following steps:

1. Declares local variables.
2. Enters a scope and declares another variable.
3. In `bb0` basic block:
   - Copies the value from the dereferenced first reference into `_2`.
4. In `bb1` basic block:
   - Copies the value from the dereferenced second reference into `_4`.
   - Copies the value from `_2` into `_5`.
   - Compares `_4` and `_5` and stores the result in `_0`.
5. Dead storage of variables and returns `_0`.```

<details>

<summary>After</summary>

`````The code snippet is a middle-end representation (MIR) of a Rust function. It takes a reference to a `&u8` and returns a `bool`. The function involves copying values, using scopes, and handling potential unwinding. Key points include:

- Copies the value pointed to by `_1` into `_6`, then copies this value into `_2`.
- Branches to `bb1` where it live-allocates `_4` and `_5`, copies `_2` into both, sets `_0` to `true`, and then dead-lifts `_4` and `_5`.
- Returns `true` at the end.```

</details>

It would be justified to make `src()` return `true` if `_6` was dereferenced again in `bb1`, however, the write in `unknown()` shouldn't invalidate the actual pointer stored in `_1` if my understanding of Stacked Borrows is correct.


This is present in both Stable and Nightly.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue isn't directly provided, but from the context of the patches, it seems related to some kind of bug fix in Rust code. The patches show changes made to several functions, particularly closures in a file named slice_filter.rs. 

Now, focusing on the body and patches: There are multiple patches (33 to 36) that modify variables, conditionals, and control flow within these closure functions. For example, in variant_a's closure, there are changes to how variables like _14, _15, etc., are used, especially around comparison operations using Le (which I assume is a less-than or equal operator). Similarly, in variant_b's closure, the patches adjust variable assignments and the conditions in switchInt statements.

The key here is to understand what kind of bug these patches are fixing. Runtime errors typically occur during the execution of the program, such as crashes, null pointer exceptions, out-of-bounds access, etc. They often manifest when certain conditions aren't handled correctly at runtime.

Looking at the changes, it seems like they're altering conditional checks and variable assignments in a way that affects control flow. For example, replacing which variables are compared or changing how boolean values are determined. This could be fixing incorrect logic that was causing unexpected behavior during execution—like an infinite loop, incorrect results, or even crashes if the wrong path was taken.

If these patches correct conditions that were leading to incorrect states or exceptions when the code runs, then yes, it's a runtime error. If they're addressing issues like incorrect output without any crash, it might still fall under runtime behavior but not necessarily an error per se. However, given the complexity of the changes and their focus on control flow and comparisons, it's likely that these patches are fixing scenarios where the program was either crashing or producing incorrect results due to logical errors in conditions.

Moreover, since the issue is labeled as a runtime error, and considering the nature of the changes (adjusting conditionals and variable usages that affect execution paths), I agree that this label accurately reflects the problem being addressed.
</think>

Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.

The issue's title is ""Miscompile in the GVN transform."" That suggests there's a problem with how the compiler is handling some optimization pass, specifically GVN (Global Value Numbering). The body of the issue gives more details through code examples and build outputs.

Looking at the code, it's Rust code involving unsafe functions and pointers. The user describes that when they run their program in debug mode, it correctly returns `false`, but in release mode with optimizations enabled, it incorrectly returns `true`. They provided MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation) before and after the GVN pass, showing how the optimization changes the code's behavior.

The issue seems to revolve around the compiler's miscompilation due to the GVN transform. The user believes that a certain transformation is causing incorrect results in release builds because of how pointers are handled, possibly related to borrow checking (Stacked Borrows) and the MIRI tool which detects undefined behavior.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an issue that occurs during the execution of the program, like a crash or unexpected output. In this case, the problem is that in release mode, the code returns `true` instead of `false`, which is an incorrect result but not necessarily a crash. The issue arises from the compiler's optimization pass, making it a miscompilation rather than a runtime error.

The user also mentions that this happens both in stable and nightly versions, pointing towards a potential bug in the compiler rather than an environmental issue.

So, the label ""runtime error"" might be misleading because the problem is with the compiler producing incorrect code (miscompilation) rather than an error during program execution. More appropriate labels could be ""compiler bug,"" ""optimization bug,"" or something related to MIR optimizations like ""GVN transform issue.""

Therefore, I think the label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect the nature of this problem.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" does not accurately capture the issue described. The problem lies in the compiler's optimization leading to incorrect results, which is a miscompilation rather than a runtime error.

microsoft/vscode,204346,out of bounds,Aux window: validate window bounds are on display bounds,"It seems that when restoring floating windows, we fail to ensure that the bounds are actually a valid location that is visible. On Windows at least this can result in floating windows being entirely hidden.

//cc @alexr00 ",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""out of bounds"" accurately reflects the issue described in these patches.

First, looking at the problem description, it seems that the issue is related to window states and ensuring they stay within monitor boundaries. The code changes involve functions that adjust window positions and sizes so they don't go beyond the screen edges, which makes sense as ""out of bounds"" refers to elements going beyond their intended limits.

In Patch 5, there's a method called `validateWindowState` being moved or modified. This function checks if the window state is within acceptable ranges and corrects it if not. The comments mention preventing windows from falling outside the screen, which aligns with the ""out of bounds"" concept.

The patches also adjust imports and exports to move this validation into a separate namespace, indicating that this functionality is being modularized or refactored for better organization. This doesn't change the core issue but shows ongoing maintenance related to preventing out-of-bounds window states.

Looking at other parts like Patches 6 and 7, they seem unrelated to window bounds. However, since the main focus of the changes is on the window state validation, those might be additional fixes in the same update but not directly tied to the label in question.

Considering all this, the ""out of bounds"" label seems appropriate because it directly relates to the problem of windows exceeding screen boundaries and the code changes made to address it.
</think>

The label ""out of bounds"" accurately reflects the issue as the patches address window states going beyond screen limits. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""out of bounds"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let me look at the title: ""Aux window: validate window bounds are on display bounds."" This suggests that the problem is about ensuring that auxiliary windows have their boundaries checked against the display's available space. The key here seems to be validation of window positions within the visible area.

Next, I'll read the body: It mentions that when restoring floating windows, there's a failure to ensure their bounds are valid and visible. Specifically on Windows, this can cause windows to be entirely hidden. So the issue is about the windows not being correctly positioned within the screen's boundaries, leading them to be out of view.

The label assigned is ""out of bounds."" This term directly relates to elements exceeding their intended limits. In this context, the window's position being outside the visible display area fits well under ""out of bounds.""

I don't see any mention of other issues like performance or bugs unrelated to positioning. The problem is clearly about the windows not staying within the viewable area, which aligns perfectly with the ""out of bounds"" label.

Therefore, I agree that the label accurately reflects the issue.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43526,forward port,Inconsistent double slashes in generated Javadoc URLs,Forward port of issue #43518 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out if the label ""forward port"" is accurate for this issue. 

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Inconsistent double slashes in generated Javadoc URLs."" It seems like the problem is about incorrect URL formatting where there are extra slashes.

The body says it's a forward port of issue #43518 to 3.4.x. So, they're taking a fix from another version and applying it here. That makes sense for a ""forward port"" label because that's exactly what a forward port entails—moving changes to a different branch or version.

Now, looking at the patches: In multiple places, URLs are being changed by removing trailing slashes. For example, in Patch 1, they change from ""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/"" to ""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api"". Similarly, in other patches, like with AssertJ and ByteBuddy, the same pattern of removing trailing slashes is applied. So, the fix involves modifying URLs to eliminate double slashes or unnecessary trailing slashes.

Since all these changes are part of a forward port from another issue, applying them to the 3.4.x branch, the label ""forward port"" seems correct because it accurately describes that this issue was addressed by bringing over fixes from a previous version.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" is appropriate as the issue involves transferring fixes from a prior version to the current one.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Inconsistent double slashes in generated Javadoc URLs"". This suggests there's a problem with how URLs are being generated, specifically having double slashes where they shouldn't be. It seems like a bug or an issue related to the functionality of generating Javadoc.

Now, the body says: ""Forward port of issue #43518 to 3.4.x."" A forward port usually refers to taking changes from one branch (often the main or development branch) and applying them to another branch, typically a maintenance or stable release branch. So this indicates that an existing fix from another branch is being moved over.

The label assigned is ""forward port"". Given that the body explicitly mentions it's a forward port of a previous issue, it makes sense. Even though the title describes the specific bug, the purpose of this particular issue is to move that fix into the 3.4.x branch.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the intent behind the issue report.

Alright, I'm trying to determine whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Nightly aarch64 cuda builds are failing since 09.19.2024."" This clearly indicates that something is wrong with the builds on ARM architecture (aarch64) using CUDA. The use of ""failing"" suggests an unexpected problem, which aligns with a bug.

Next, examining the body of the issue. There's a link to a failed GitHub Action run, and a code snippet showing an internal compiler error in FlashAttentionKernel.cpp.SVE256.cpp. The error message mentions an internal compiler error during the RTL pass, specifically pointing to line 555 where a lambda function is defined. This kind of error is unexpected behavior from the compiler or the code, which fits the definition of a bug.

The user also references a recent pull request that was merged on September 18, 2024, titled ""Extending the Pytorch vec backend for SVE (ARM)."" This suggests that the issue might be related to changes introduced by this PR. Since it's a new feature or modification, any unexpected behavior here would still fall under a bug.

Looking at the patches provided, they modify several lines in the code where conditional checks are made against the compiler version and ARM features. The original condition checked for __GNUC__ == 11 and __GNUC_MINOR__ >=4 along with __ARM_FEATURE_SVE. The patch removes the minor version check, leaving it to just check for __GNUC__ ==11 and SVE support.

This change indicates that the bug was occurring because the code wasn't compatible with certain versions of the compiler when using ARM's SVE features. Adjusting these conditions likely resolved the internal compiler error, which confirms that this was a bug in how the code handled compiler versions or SVE features.

Considering all this, the issue is about unexpected and erroneous behavior in the code due to specific conditions not being handled correctly. This fits perfectly under the ""bug"" label.
</think>

The issue report describes an unexpected problem causing build failures related to recent changes, confirmed by patches adjusting compiler condition checks. The situation aligns with a bug.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""Nightly aarch64 cuda builds are failing since 09.19.2024."" This indicates that there's a consistent failure in the nightly builds specifically for ARM architecture with CUDA support starting from September 19, 2024. The use of ""failing"" suggests an unexpected problem.

Now, examining the body of the issue: It starts by linking to a failed GitHub Action run, which provides evidence of the failure. There's a code snippet showing an internal compiler error in a specific file related to FlashAttentionKernel.cpp.SVE256.cpp. The error message mentions an internal compiler error during the RTL pass, specifically at line 555, column 57. This is a clear indication that something went wrong during compilation, which points to a bug either in the code or the compiler.

The body also references a recent pull request that was merged on September 18, 2024, titled ""Extending the Pytorch vec backend for SVE (ARM)."" This suggests that the issue might be related to changes introduced by this PR. The mention of submitting a full bug report and including preprocessed source further indicates that it's a problem that needs attention from the development team.

The versions section states version 2.6.0, which helps in identifying if this is an ongoing issue in the current codebase. The CC mentions several people, likely maintainers or contributors involved with SVE or ARM optimizations.

Putting all together: The title reports build failures, the body shows a compiler error linked to recent changes, and it's clearly a problem that needs fixing. Therefore, labeling this as ""bug"" is accurate because it describes an unexpected issue causing build failures.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue report as it documents a build failure with a specific error related to code changes.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""serialization"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Investigate getting all globals that need to be added to `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals` in one call rather than iteratively."" The title mentions `add_safe_globals`, which is part of the serialization module in PyTorch. This suggests that the issue revolves around the process of adding safe globals during deserialization.

Next, the body of the issue explains that currently, when loading a model with `torch.load()`, it might fail due to unsupported GLOBALs. The user has to iteratively add these globals using `add_safe_globals` until the load succeeds. The suggestion is to find all necessary globals in one go for efficiency. This again points towards serialization, as it's about handling pickle files and their global references.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a new function `get_unsafe_globals_in_checkpoint` to the documentation. This implies that a utility function was added to help identify problematic globals during deserialization.

Patch 2 introduces a test for this new function, ensuring it correctly identifies unsafe globals in a checkpoint. The test uses serialization methods and checks against expected global strings, further tying it to serialization.

Patch 3 modifies existing code related to reading pickle files. It adds the `get_globals_in_pkl` function, which parses the pickle data to extract GLOBAL instructions. This is core to how PyTorch handles deserialization of saved models.

Patch 4 updates the documentation and adds the public function `get_unsafe_globals_in_checkpoint`, which uses the new utility to find unsafe globals in a checkpoint file. This function's purpose is to help users identify all necessary globals upfront, improving the serialization process.

All patches are within files related to PyTorch's serialization mechanisms. They introduce tools to analyze and handle globalization during deserialization more effectively. The common thread across all changes is enhancing how the library manages global references when loading saved models, which falls under the umbrella of serialization.

Therefore, the label ""serialization"" accurately captures the essence of this issue report. It directly relates to improvements in handling global variables during the deserialization process, which is a key aspect of PyTorch's serialization functionality.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""serialization"" correctly reflects the GitHub issue described here. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""Investigate getting all globals that need to be added to `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals` in one call rather than iteratively."" It mentions `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`, which is part of PyTorch's serialization module. So the issue is related to how globals are handled during serialization.

In the body, the user explains a problem where they have to repeatedly add safe globals using `add_safe_globals` each time a global is missing when calling `torch.load()`. They suggest parsing the pickle file for GLOBALs to get all necessary ones at once. They also reference `pickletools.dis()`, which is a tool for analyzing Python pickles, further indicating that this is about how data is serialized and loaded.

The issue is about improving the efficiency of adding safe globals during deserialization. Since `torch.serialization` deals with loading and saving models, and the functions mentioned like `add_safe_globals` are part of this module, it makes sense that the label ""serialization"" fits here.

I don't see any mention of other topics like performance, bug fixes, or new features outside of how data is serialized. So yes, ""serialization"" accurately captures the essence of the issue.
</think>

The label ""serialization"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to handling globals during deserialization in PyTorch.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33421,concurrency,Deadlock between SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest when clients disconnect,"We have been tracking rather strange & random failures in our application: eventually, after many browser closed (and/or page refresh), our SSE event flux would not be sending anything anymore to new clients.

We identified that threads used for async tasks execution (AsyncSupportConfigurer) may deadlock due to a timing-dependant ABBA deadlock between SseEmitter sending and error handling on connection closed.
If using the the default SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor which fires up a new Thread for each task, no user visible effect (except that some deadlocked unused threads are consumming resources on the server).
But, if using a fixed number of threads (as we do in our application), the system may finally come to a halt (when all worker threads have been deadlocked).

What we think is going on (see example jstack trace captured): 
- The client is connected to the SSE endpoint:
- For an object to be written to the sse flux:
    - the SseEmitter locks itself (synchronized on super.send(...))
    - then the Object is serialized (Jackson)
    - eventually, writing/flushing on the output stream will require StandardServletAsyncWebRequest to aquire its stateLock ReentrantLock
- The client disconnects abruptly (browser closed), while the object is being serialized:
   - the server ""sees"" that the connection has been closed (probably because another object is sent concurrently on the SseEmitter)
   - this triggers StandardServletAsyncWebRequest.onError handling process that first locks the stateLock ReentrantLock and then calls SseEmitter.completeWithError which wants to lock itself (synchronized)
So, we think that there's a potential ABBA deadlock between SSE error handling and concurrent SSE sending. 

Things are highly timing dependent, but we have been able to reproduce (with high probablity) our observed deadlocks:
the idea is to emit big JSON objects (increasing the concurrency window) and normal objects concurrenty on the flux, while closing the browser

Reproduced with spring boot 3.3.2 (springframework 6.1.11) and also 3.3.3 (springframework 6.1.12)


Steps to reproduce:
=============

See the minimalist example attached, with the following steps to reproduce:

- Launch the main class
    - note the process PID for further reference
- Using a browser as an http client, go to the index.html via url : <URL>
- Refresh the browser
- Run the ""jstack $PID"" command
    - You should notice 1 deadlock (varying probability, but still very likely)
- For each additional refresh, an additional deadlock may appear

Example of deadlock captured using jstack:
=============================

```The log indicates a single Java-level deadlock involving two threads: ""http-nio-8080-exec-3"" and ""task-4"". 

- ""http-nio-8080-exec-3"" is waiting to acquire a lock on an `SseEmitter` object while holding a lock on a `DeferredResult`.
- ""task-4"" is waiting to acquire a lock on a `ReentrantLock` while holding a lock on the `DeferredResult`.

This results in a deadlock where each thread is waiting for the other to release its lock.```

Okay, let's try to figure out if the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the title and body of the issue. The title mentions a deadlock between SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest when clients disconnect. Deadlocks are typically related to concurrency issues because they occur when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource.

Looking at the body, it describes how under certain conditions with multiple browser refreshes and SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections, the application starts failing. They identified that this is due to an ABBA deadlock involving locks on SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest. The problem arises when threads involved in async tasks deadlock because of timing-dependent lock acquisition orders.

The steps to reproduce involve closing browsers abruptly, which likely causes the server to handle disconnections asynchronously, leading to concurrent access issues. They provided a jstack trace showing two threads waiting for each other's locks, a classic symptom of a deadlock caused by concurrency.

Now, looking at the patches. The main changes are in how locks are obtained. They introduced a method tryObtainLock() that uses a timeout and checks the state before acquiring the lock. This is meant to prevent deadlocks by avoiding indefinite waits and ensuring proper state transitions. Several methods were updated to use this new locking mechanism, replacing previous obtainLockAndCheckState calls.

The patches focus on modifying how locks are handled in asynchronous contexts, which directly relates to concurrency management. The goal is to prevent the deadlock scenario by improving lock acquisition with timeouts and better state checking.

Given that deadlocks, thread safety, and proper lock handling are all core aspects of concurrency issues, the label ""concurrency"" seems appropriate here. The problem described and the solution applied both pertain to how multiple threads interact and access shared resources without running into deadlock situations.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me read through the title and body carefully.

The title mentions a deadlock between SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest when clients disconnect. Deadlocks are typically related to concurrency issues because they occur when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource. So that's a hint that concurrency might be relevant here.

Looking at the body, the user describes strange failures after many browser closures or refreshes. They've identified that async task execution threads may deadlock due to an ABBA deadlock. The problem seems to happen when using a fixed number of threads in their application. They provide steps to reproduce and a jstack trace showing the deadlock.

The explanation goes into detail about how the deadlock occurs: the SseEmitter locks itself while sending data, then during serialization, it tries to write/flush, which requires acquiring a lock from StandardServletAsyncWebRequest. If the client disconnects abruptly, an error handling process starts, which also tries to acquire locks in a specific order, leading to a potential ABBA deadlock.

The jstack trace shows two threads waiting for each other's locks. Thread ""http-nio-8080-exec-3"" is waiting to lock an SseEmitter object held by ""task-4"", while ""task-4"" is waiting for a ReentrantLock held by the first thread. This is a classic deadlock scenario.

The issue revolves around how different threads are accessing shared resources (like locks) in an order that can cause them to block each other. Since concurrency issues often involve problems with threading, synchronization, and lock management, this fits under the ""concurrency"" label.

I don't see any mention of other labels like ""bug"", ""performance"", or ""documentation"". The problem is specifically about thread behavior and deadlocks during concurrent operations, so ""concurrency"" seems accurate here.

Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if the label ""workspace"" correctly reflects this GitHub issue report. The issue has a specific title and body, and there are two patches that resolved it.

First, looking at the title: It mentions an error related to the ""-mod"" flag when not in workspace mode. That immediately makes me think about how Go modules work, especially regarding workspace setups. So the problem seems tied to using the module system correctly.

The body of the issue shows that running govulncheck with version 1.0.2 causes an error about the ""-mod=mod"" flag. The user tried installing the latest version and encountered this problem. It looks like the tool was trying to run a command that requires workspace mode but wasn't in it, hence the error.

Now, looking at the patches. Patch 1 modifies how the 'go list' command is called. Instead of always using ""-mod=mod"", it checks if there's a ""vendor"" directory. If so, it uses ""-mod=readonly"". This adjustment seems to handle cases where the tool runs in a vendored module without being in workspace mode. The comment mentions go.dev/issue/65155 and 65124, which I assume are related to module handling and workspaces.

Patch 2 adds a new function 'fileExists' that checks if a file exists. This is used in Patch 1 to determine whether to adjust the command-line arguments for 'go list'. So the main change is about how modules are loaded when the tool runs, especially concerning vendor directories and workspace settings.

The assigned label is ""workspace"". Considering all this, the problem revolves around the tool's behavior when it's not run in a workspace but tries to use flags that require it. The patches fix this by adjusting module loading based on whether the code is in a vendored directory or not, thus avoiding the need for workspace mode when unnecessary.

So yes, the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the issue because it's about handling cases where the tool isn't in workspace mode and needs to adjust its module flags accordingly.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue described by its title and body. Let me start by reading through the details provided.

The title of the issue is: ""x/vuln: go: -mod may only be set to readonly when in workspace mode, but it is set to 'mod' error starting in 1.0.2"". From this, I can tell that the problem has something to do with the '-mod' flag and an error related to workspace mode.

Looking at the body, there's a shell script showing two scenarios: one where govulncheck version v1.0.1 runs without issues and another where installing the latest version (v1.0.2) leads to an error. The error message says that ""-mod may only be set to readonly when in workspace mode, but it is set to 'mod'"". It suggests either removing the -mod flag or setting GOWORK=off.

So, the issue arises after upgrading to v1.0.2 of govulncheck, and it's related to module flags and workspace mode. The error message explicitly mentions ""workspace mode,"" which indicates that the problem is tied to how Go modules are handled when in a workspace setup.

The label assigned here is ""workspace"". Given that the error directly references workspace mode and suggests setting GOWORK, this label seems appropriate because it's pointing towards an issue specific to workspaces in Go. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue report.

This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""failure"" correctly applies to this issue report. Let me start by understanding what's in the problem.

Looking at the title of the issue, it says: ""Add backoff [sic] for Azure Blob Storage when throttled"". So, the main goal here seems to be about adding a backoff mechanism, which I think is related to handling retries when there are throttle issues from Azure. Throttling usually means that the service is limiting the number of requests, so adding backoff would help in retrying those failed requests after some delay.

Now, looking at the patches provided, they seem to modify several files across different packages. Let me go through each patch and see what's being changed.

In Patch 1 (azure/blobcontainer.py), there are imports added for `time` and `random`, which makes sense because backoff typically involves waiting and retrying. Then, in the `AzureBlobContainer` class, a new constructor parameter `backoff` is added with a default of `None`. The `do_request` method now includes a loop that retries the request up to `max_retries` times if it gets a 429 (Too Many Requests) error. It uses exponential backoff by waiting for a random time between 0 and `2^attempt * factor` seconds.

So, this patch is clearly about adding retry logic with backoff when facing throttling from Azure.

Moving to Patch 9 (moved from azure package to http), there's a refactoring of the `ResponseInjectingHttpHandler` class. It seems that this handler is used in tests to simulate HTTP responses, including errors. The changes here are more about code structure and visibility, making some methods public and adjusting how request handlers are implemented.

In Patch 7 (test_azure_blob_container.py), a new test method `test_compare_and_exchange_when_throttled` is added. This test checks if the container correctly handles throttling by retrying the update operation. It sets up multiple throttling responses and verifies that the final state reflects the correct data after retries.

Other patches like 3,4,5,6,8 adjust similar retry logic with backoff in different parts of the codebase, ensuring that when a request is throttled (returns 429), it's retried with appropriate delays. They also modify test cases to simulate these scenarios and ensure the system behaves correctly under such conditions.

Putting this all together, the problem being addressed is how the application handles situations where Azure Blob Storage is throttling requests. Without proper backoff, the application might fail or not retry effectively. By adding exponential backoff with retries, it becomes more resilient against such issues.

The label ""failure"" is assigned to this issue. Now, does that make sense? The problem is about handling failures (specifically 429 errors) by implementing retries with backoff. So yes, the core of the issue is dealing with failure scenarios in network requests and ensuring reliable operation through retry mechanisms.

Therefore, I think the label ""failure"" accurately reflects this issue because it's primarily about handling situations where requests fail due to throttling and ensuring the system can recover from those failures.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""failure"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by looking at the title and body of the issue.

The title is ""[CI] GCSSnapshotRepoTestKitIT testRepositoryAnalysis failing"". That clearly states that a test called testRepositoryAnalysis in something related to GCS is failing. So right away, it's indicating an issue where a test is not passing.

Moving on to the body, there are several sections that provide more details. Under ""Build Scans"", there are links to specific builds that failed. That suggests CI/CD pipelines are encountering issues here. The reproduction line gives the command used to run the failing test, which helps in replicating the problem.

The applicable branches section mentions 8.15, so this is happening on a specific branch of the codebase. ""Reproduces locally?: N/A"" might mean it's not necessary or hasn't been tried yet. 

Looking at the failure history, there's a link to a dashboard, which probably tracks how often this test has failed over time. The failure message itself is quite detailed. It shows an exception from the Elasticsearch client: a ResponseException with HTTP 500 status. The error messages talk about repository verification exceptions and issues with blob references, indicating that something went wrong during the test execution related to snapshot repositories.

Under ""Issue Reasons"", it breaks down the failures by different criteria. There are two failures in the specific test (testRepositoryAnalysis) out of 87 executions, which is a low failure rate but still present. The same test also failed twice in step third-party_gcs with a higher fail rate, and similarly in the pipeline elasticsearch-periodic.

The note at the end mentions this was created via test triage automation, so it's likely part of a system that flags failing tests automatically.

Putting all this together: the issue is about a failing test in CI/CD pipelines. The label ""failure"" seems appropriate because it accurately describes the problem as a test failure. There are specific error messages and statistics showing the test doesn't pass consistently, which aligns with what a ""failure"" label would indicate.

Using `ConfigurableApplicationContext#getBeanProvider(TestBean.class)` works as expected and return the three configured instances.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""injection"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is: ""Injection point using ObjectProvider should not apply bean by name fallback for orderedStream."" Hmm, that sounds a bit technical, but I know it relates to dependency injection in Spring Framework since we're talking about ApplicationContext and TestBean instances.

Looking at the body, the user explains that when using an ObjectProvider to inject TestBeans, there's a regression where only one bean is returned instead of all three. They mention that the issue arises because the current code applies a bean by name shortcut, which isn't expected in this context. They also note that using getBean() directly works fine, so it's specific to how ObjectProvider is handling things.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are several changes in test files where method names and variable names related to ObjectProvider are being updated. For example, in one file, they change testBeanProvider to testBean and update the corresponding getter methods. In another part, they adjust the test cases to expect multiple beans instead of a single instance.

So, the problem seems to be about how dependency injection is handled when using ObjectProvider. The fix involves modifying the tests to correctly handle multiple bean instances and ensuring that the ObjectProvider doesn't fall back to a single bean by name when it shouldn't.

The label assigned was ""injection."" I'm trying to see if this makes sense. Dependency injection issues often relate to how objects are provided with their dependencies, which is exactly what's happening here. The problem is about how the ObjectProvider (which is part of the injection mechanism) is fetching beans, so it fits under dependency injection concerns.

I don't see any other obvious labels that would better fit this issue. It's not a bug in the UI or performance but specifically about how dependencies are injected using Spring's features. Therefore, the label ""injection"" accurately reflects the nature of the problem and its solution.
</think>

The label ""injection"" correctly captures the essence of the issue, which pertains to dependency injection mechanisms in Spring Framework.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""injection"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the issue details carefully.

The title of the issue is: ""Injection point using ObjectProvider should not apply bean by name fallback for orderedStream."" Okay, that's a bit technical, but it mentions injection points and ObjectProvider, which I know are related to dependency injection in Spring Framework. The body goes on to explain that there's a regression in version 6.2.x where using an ObjectProvider with orderedStream() results in only one bean being injected instead of multiple.

Looking at the code example provided, it shows a class Example with a constructor that injects an ObjectProvider<TestBean>. Then it uses testBean.orderedStream(), which should return all available instances but is only returning one. The user mentions that using ConfigurableApplicationContext#getBeanProvider works as expected, getting three beans, so the problem seems specific to how ObjectProvider is handling this scenario.

The label in question here is ""injection."" Dependency injection is definitely at play here because we're talking about how beans are being provided and injected into components. The issue revolves around the incorrect behavior of the injection mechanism when using ObjectProvider, specifically with ordered streams and bean name fallbacks.

So, does the term ""injection"" capture the essence of this problem? Yes, because it's about how dependencies (beans) are being injected into the application. The bug is related to the injection point not behaving as expected, applying a fallback when it shouldn't. This directly ties into dependency injection concerns in Spring.

I don't see any other more specific labels mentioned, and ""injection"" seems broad enough to cover this type of issue. It's possible that there could be more precise labels like ""dependency-injection"" or ""objectprovider,"" but based on the provided label, ""injection"" is accurate.

The label ""injection"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to dependency injection in Spring Framework.

blocking an upgrade",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the issue says.

The title is about Svelte versions 4 and 5, mentioning that whitespaces are being rendered where there shouldn't be any, specifically referencing the &#xFEFFF; character. So this seems related to an upgrade from version 4 to 5 because the user encountered a new bug after moving to Svelte 5.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user describes a bug where whitespace characters appear between elements when they shouldn't. They provided images and a reproduction repository. The steps involve creating a new project with Svelte 5 preview, which indicates it's about an upgrade scenario. They also mention that this is blocking their upgrade, which suggests it's a significant issue preventing them from moving to the newer version.

Now, considering the patches applied: Patch 1 mentions stripping the BOM (Byte Order Mark) character from input. Patches 2 and 3 show code changes where functions like compile, compileModule, and parse now include removing the BOM by checking if the source starts with &#xFEFF; and slicing it off if present. There's also a test added to ensure this fix works.

So the issue arises when upgrading from Svelte 4 to 5, causing unexpected whitespace due to the BOM character. The patches specifically target this problem by removing the BOM at the start of the source. This means the bug is directly tied to the upgrade process and the behavior changes between versions.

The label ""upgrade"" was assigned, which seems appropriate because the issue occurs during the transition from an older version (4) to a newer one (5). The problem wasn't present before upgrading, so it's indeed an upgrade-related issue. 

Therefore, I agree that the label accurately reflects the report.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""upgrade"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue described by the user. Let's start by reading through the issue details carefully.

The title of the issue is ""Svelte 4 > 5 - Whitespaces are rendered where there are none (&#xFEFFF;)"". This immediately tells me that the problem occurs when upgrading from Svelte version 4 to version 5. The body elaborates on this, explaining that the user encountered unexpected whitespaces between elements, which are represented by the character &#xFEFFF;. They provided images and steps to reproduce the issue, including setting up a new project with Svelte 5 preview.

Looking at the reproduction steps, the user created a minimal project using `npm create svelte@latest`, selected the Svelte 5 preview, and installed dependencies. After adding some empty layouts and pages, they observed line breaks where there shouldn't be any. They also mentioned that this issue is blocking their upgrade to Svelte 5.

The system info shows they're on Windows, using Arc browser and JetBrains Rider as their IDE, which probably isn't directly relevant but gives context about their environment.

The label assigned was ""upgrade"". The question is whether this label accurately reflects the issue. Since the problem arises specifically during an upgrade from Svelte 4 to 5, the term ""upgrade"" does seem appropriate. However, sometimes in GitHub issues, more specific labels like ""bug"", ""rendering-issue"", or ""regression"" might be used alongside ""upgrade"" to provide better context.

But looking at the provided label, ""upgrade"" is indeed relevant because the issue is directly tied to upgrading versions and encountering a problem that blocks further upgrade. So I think the label does fit here.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""conflict resolution"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that fixed it.

First, let me read through the issue details again. The title is about editing notes in the ""Conflicts"" folder causing them to temporarily disappear. The user provided steps to reproduce: opening a note from Conflicts, modifying it, and then seeing it vanish until they navigate away and back. They expected that the note shouldn't disappear while being edited.

Looking at the patches, I see several changes. Patch 1 modifies the function `formNoteToNote` to include `is_conflict`. It seems like this function now returns a `NoteEntity` with the `is_conflict` property set from `formNote.is_conflict`.

Patch 2 adds an optional `is_conflict` field to the `FormNote` interface. So now, when a form note is created or updated, it can carry whether it's in conflict.

Patch 3 introduces a test case that checks if `is_conflict` is preserved when saving the note. It mocks a note with `is_conflict: 1`, uses the `formNoteToNote` function, and expects the resulting note to have `is_conflict: 1`.

Patch 4 updates the `useFormNote` hook to include `n.is_conflict` in the form note, ensuring that this property is correctly passed around.

Putting it all together, the issue was that when editing a conflict note, it would disappear because somewhere in the code, the `is_conflict` flag wasn't being handled properly. The patches ensure that when converting between form notes and actual notes, the conflict status isn't lost. This way, the UI knows not to remove the note from the list when edited.

So the problem was related to handling conflicts correctly—specifically, making sure that notes marked as conflicts don't get removed or lose their status during editing. Therefore, the label ""conflict resolution"" fits because it's about properly managing and preserving conflict states in the application.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue, which involved preserving the conflict state when editing notes to prevent them from disappearing.

1",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""conflict resolution"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The title says that editing notes in the ""Conflicts"" folder causes them to temporarily disappear. That immediately catches my attention because it's about a specific behavior when working with notes in a certain folder, not necessarily about resolving conflicts in general.

Looking at the body, the user provides details like their operating system (Linux), Joplin version, and various plugins they're using. The steps to reproduce are clear: start Joplin, open a note from the ""Conflicts"" notebook, modify it, and then the note disappears from the list until navigating away and back.

The expected behavior is that the conflict shouldn't disappear while editing, which suggests this is more about how notes are handled in the ""Conflicts"" folder rather than the process of resolving conflicts between different versions or sources.

Now, considering what ""conflict resolution"" typically refers to in software terms. Usually, it's about mechanisms that handle conflicting changes when merging data from different sources, like in version control systems. For example, if two people edit the same file and their changes clash, conflict resolution tools help merge those changes.

In this case, the issue isn't about resolving such conflicts but rather a bug where editing a note in the ""Conflicts"" folder causes it to vanish temporarily. The problem lies in the user interface or how Joplin manages notes within that specific folder during editing, not the process of resolving data conflicts between different versions or sources.

So, does the label ""conflict resolution"" fit here? It seems like a stretch because the issue isn't about handling conflicting changes but rather a UI/behavior bug in a particular notebook. A more accurate label might be something like ""bug"", ""UI issue"", or ""note management"".

Therefore, I don't think ""conflict resolution"" accurately reflects this problem.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Gradle Plugin AOT documentation has sample error."" This immediately suggests that there's an issue with the documentation related to the Gradle Plugin for Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation in Spring Boot.

Next, the body of the issue includes a link to the specific documentation page and an image screenshot. The user provided a URL and an attached image, which likely points out where the error is in the documentation. Since I can't view the image directly, but based on context, it's safe to assume that it highlights an error or incorrect information in the docs.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. The patch shows changes made to a file, specifically removing some lines related to Groovy and Kotlin examples. It seems like the problematic part of the documentation was an example that had errors, so those sections were removed or corrected.

The label assigned is ""documentation."" Considering all these points—the title mentions documentation error, the body provides context about where the error is, and the patches involve modifying the documentation content—it's clear that the issue pertains to a problem in the documentation. 

There’s no indication that this issue relates to a bug in the codebase or a feature request. It's strictly about correcting an error in the provided examples within the documentation. Therefore, the label ""documentation"" is appropriate and accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

The user is pointing out an error in the sample code or example within that documentation. So they're indicating that there's an issue with the documentation content itself.

The label ""documentation"" is used to categorize issues related to inaccuracies, typos, or other problems in the project's documentation. Since this issue directly concerns an error found in a specific part of the Spring Boot docs, applying the ""documentation"" label makes sense. It helps maintainers quickly identify that the problem lies within their documentation resources rather than the codebase.

I don't see any information suggesting another category like ""bug,"" ""enhancement,"" or others. The focus is clearly on correcting an error in the provided documentation. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue report.

facebook/react-native,47905,regression,[Android] borderRadius & border(Top|Right|LeftBottom)Color='transparent' don't work properly together ,"### Description

Hello, 

When both `borderRadius` and on the borderRightColor (or any other edge) is set to transparent then Android ignores other borderColors set resulting with no borders being rendered.

Bug is only reproducible on Android. It works perfectly fine on iOS.
We encountered this issue after bumping react-native version from `0.74.3` -> `0.76.2`. Bug still exists in RN `0.76.3`.

## Example
Example says more than 1000 words so here it is:
<URL>

```The code snippet sets CSS border colors and radius for an element, with top and bottom borders in orange and magenta, left border transparent, right border blue, and a border radius of 10.```

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression means in software terms. A regression typically refers to a bug or unintended behavior that appears after a change was made to the codebase, especially when upgrading versions or introducing new features.

Looking at the issue report's title: ""[Android] borderRadius & border(Top|Right|LeftBottom)Color='transparent' don't work properly together."" The user is reporting an issue specific to Android where certain border properties aren't rendering correctly when some are set to transparent and others have colors. This behavior wasn't present in a previous version of React Native, specifically after upgrading from 0.74.3 to 0.76.2.

The body of the report mentions that the problem started after bumping the React Native version, which implies that the bug was introduced by an update. They also provided steps to reproduce and examples showing different behaviors on iOS versus Android, confirming it's platform-specific.

The patches provided are from two separate files in the repository. Both changes modify conditions related to when borders should be clipped based on their colors' alpha values. The original condition required all border colors to be non-transparent (using &&), which was causing issues when some were transparent and others weren't. The fix changed this to check if any of the colors are non-transparent (using ||), ensuring that borders render correctly even with mixed transparent and colored edges.

Since the issue arose after an upgrade, it's a regression because the change introduced unintended behavior compared to previous versions. The patches address this by adjusting how border rendering conditions are evaluated, fixing the bug without reverting other changes.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let me start by understanding what a regression means in software terms. A regression is when a bug or issue appears in a newer version of a software that wasn't present in an older version. It's like taking a step backward in functionality.

Looking at the title: ""[Android] borderRadius & border(Top|Right|LeftBottom)Color='transparent' don't work properly together"". This suggests there's an issue with how certain border styles are being applied on Android, specifically when using transparent colors along with borderRadius. The problem isn't happening on iOS, which works as expected.

In the body, the user provides more details. They mention that this bug appeared after upgrading React Native from version 0.74.3 to 0.76.2 and is still present in 0.76.3. So, it's clear that this issue wasn't there before but started occurring after an update. The example they provided shows how on Android, the borders aren't rendered correctly when these styles are applied together, whereas iOS handles it fine.

They also included steps to reproduce, which helps confirm that the problem is consistent and tied to specific style settings. Additionally, the React Native version info and environment details help pinpoint where the issue might lie without needing more context.

Since this bug appeared after an update and wasn't present before, it fits the definition of a regression. The label ""regression"" is appropriate here because it accurately describes that this is a new issue introduced in a later version of React Native.
</think>

The label ""regression"" correctly reflects the issue as it's a bug introduced in a newer version of React Native that wasn't present before.

golang/go,65167,bug,x/tools/gopls: filter noisy code actions when triggerKind is automatic,"gopls version: built @  c467be361ab7f9641e4ffefaa23e0eedfb7ea10e

### What did I do?

Triggered printf diagnostics and SA1006 diagnostics

```The code snippet writes ""run uploading"" to the standard error stream.```

Settings:
```This code snippet configures settings for the Go language server in a code editor. It enables static checking diagnostics via `gopls` and sets the language server flags to enable RPC tracing.```
### What did you expect

Gopls detects the issue and provides quick fixes for these diagnostics.

### What did you see instead

Gopls detected the issues, but code actions are not available from the editor (neither with the light bulb nor the Quick Fix hover)

* Light bulb on editor and Hover on editor - don't work.
![Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 10 07 13 AM](<URL>
![Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 10 23 46 AM](<URL>

* Light bulb on PROBLEMS panel - sort of worked
![Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 10 06 57 AM](<URL>

- Lightbulb for SA1006 worked (except the duplicated code actions).
- Lightbulb for printf analysis is not present.

### Traces

It looks like VS Code triggers code actions in different ways. 
<URL>

1) Light bulb on editor

VS Code sent a request asking for quick fixes for detected problems. (See ""context"" filled with the diagnostic&its source, and `triggerKind:2` (TriggerKind: ""Automatic""). Gopls returned ""inline call to Fprintln"" code action, which doesn't make sense.

```The log shows a code action request sent for file `main.go` at line 291, character 1, due to a diagnostic related to a redundant newline in a `fmt.Fprintln` call. The response provides a refactor suggestion to inline the call to `Fprintln`.```

Note that VS Code asked quick fixes for ""printf"" analyzer, but not for SA1006 analyzer's report. This can be a client-side issue and I will investigate it separately.

2) Hover on editor

VS Code sent the request asking for quick fixes for detected problems. (See ""context"" filled with the diagnostic&its source, and `triggerKind:1` (TriggerKind ""Invoked""). Gopls returned nothing.

```The log shows that a code action request was sent for the file `main.go` at line 291, character 1 to 43. The request was triggered by a diagnostic message indicating that the `fmt.Fprintln` call has a redundant newline at the end of its argument list. The response to this request returned `null`.```

3) Light bulb on PROBLEMS panel

VS Code sent request with ""quickfix"" and ""triggerKind: 1"". Gopls returned some code actions for SA1006 diagnostic (but with duplications)

```The log shows a code action request sent at 10:46:11.180 AM for file `/Users/hakim/projects/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry/main.go` at line 162, character 1 to 53. The request was triggered by a diagnostic message indicating that `fmt.Fprintf` should be replaced with `fmt.Fprint` due to the use of a printf-style function with a dynamic format string and no additional arguments. The server responded with two identical quickfix suggestions to replace `fmt.Fprintf` with `fmt.Fprint`, both pointing to the same range in the code and proposing the same edit.```

But didn't return codeactions for printf diagnostic.

```The log shows that a code action request was sent for the file `main.go` at line 291, character 1 to 43. The request was triggered by a diagnostic message indicating that the `fmt.Fprintln` call has a redundant newline at the end of its argument list. The response to this request returned `null`, indicating no actions were available or suggested.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this issue report. Let me read through everything carefully.

The issue seems to be about a problem with code actions not showing up as expected in VS Code when using gopls. The user provided several patches that were made to fix the issue. From what I understand, the main problem was related to how code actions were being handled, specifically with the 'quickfix' kind and ensuring they appear correctly under certain conditions.

Looking at the title of the report: ""gopls doesn't return quickfixes when using triggerkind=invoked."" That sounds like a bug because it's describing unexpected behavior—gopls isn't returning the expected actions when it should be. 

The body explains that gopls wasn't correctly handling code actions, leading to missing quick fixes in certain UI contexts. The provided patches modify how these code actions are bundled and retrieved, indicating that there was a flaw in the previous implementation.

The label ""bug"" is assigned here, which makes sense because it's about fixing an unintended behavior. All the patches seem aimed at correcting this issue rather than adding new features or improvements. Therefore, I agree with the label.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the title and body carefully.

The title is: ""x/tools/gopls: filter noisy code actions when triggerKind is automatic"". From the title alone, it seems like there's an issue with gopls where certain code actions are being triggered automatically but might be causing noise or unnecessary results. So, this could indicate a bug because it's unexpected behavior.

Looking at the body, the user explains that they're using specific settings with gopls and triggered some diagnostics related to printf and SA1006. They expected quick fixes for these issues but instead found that code actions weren't available in the editor via light bulb or hover. The problem panel did show some actions, but not all.

The user provided traces showing how VS Code interacts with gopls through LSP requests. For example, when the triggerKind is automatic (2), gopls returns a code action for Fprintln that doesn't make sense in context. When triggered by hover (triggerKind 1), it returned null for printf diagnostics but did provide actions for SA1006, albeit with duplicates.

So, putting this together: the issue is about gopls not correctly handling certain code action triggers, leading to missing or incorrect quick fixes. This seems like unexpected behavior that's causing problems for the user, which fits the definition of a bug. The problem isn't just a feature request or configuration issue but something wrong with how the code actions are being processed under different trigger conditions.

Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" is accurate because it's an unintended behavior causing issues.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue where gopls incorrectly handles code action triggers, leading to unexpected behavior.

rust-lang/rust,123712,vector,String::to_lowercase does not get vectorized well contrary to code comments,"I'm looking into the performance of `to_lowercase` / `to_uppercase`on mostly ascii strings, using a small microbenchmark added to `library/alloc/benches/string.rs`. 

```This Rust code snippet defines a benchmark function `bench_to_lowercase` that measures the performance of converting a given string to lowercase using the `to_lowercase` method. The string is defined within the function and passed to `b.iter`, which iterates over the operation to be benchmarked.```

Using linux perf tooling I see that the hot part of the code is the following large loop, which despite heavy use of sse2 instructions only seems to process 32 bytes per iteration.

```The code snippet is an assembly routine that processes data using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations with XMM registers. It involves loading data from memory, shuffling and manipulating vectors, and storing results back to memory. Key operations include:

- Loading data into XMM registers.
- Using shuffle instructions (`pshufd`) to rearrange vector elements.
- Logical and bitwise operations (`andpd`, `pand`, `por`, `psrlq`, `psllq`).
- Vector arithmetic (`packuswb`, `paddb`, `pminub`).
- Storing results back to memory.

The code iterates over a block of data, processing it in chunks and updating pointers as it progresses.```

I don't see an easy way to improve the autovectorization of this code, but it should be relatively easy to explicitly vectorize it using `portable_simd`, and I would like to prepare such a PR if there are no objections. As far as I know, `portable_simd` is already in use inside `core`, for example by #103779.",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to determine whether the label ""vector"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break down each part to understand better.

First, looking at the title: it seems to be about improving the autovectorization of a specific function in Rust's standard library, probably related to string case conversion like `to_lowercase` or similar. The mention of SIMD instructions suggests that vector operations are involved here.

Now, reading through the body of the issue, it talks about modifying functions to improve their performance by leveraging auto-vectorization. Auto-vectorization is a compiler technique where loops are automatically converted into vectorized code, which can run more efficiently on modern CPUs with SIMD capabilities. The user provided patches that change how certain string operations process ASCII bytes, aiming for better vectorization.

Looking at the patches, especially Patch 2 and Patch 4, there's a focus on processing chunks of data (like 16 bytes) to enable auto-vectorization. They use techniques such as checking all bytes in a chunk are ASCII using SIMD-friendly methods, which helps the compiler generate more efficient code. The tests added also check for specific vectorized instructions in the generated code, like loading 16 bytes and performing operations on them.

The label ""vector"" is typically used to indicate issues related to SIMD or vectorization optimizations. Given that the problem revolves around enhancing auto-vectorization for performance gains, this label seems appropriate. It accurately captures the essence of the changes made, which are all about improving how the code uses vectorized instructions to process data in chunks.

So, putting it all together: the issue is indeed about vector optimization through better auto-vectorization techniques, and the patches reflect that by restructuring the code to work in fixed-size chunks conducive to SIMD processing. Therefore, the label ""vector"" accurately describes this issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""vector"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""String::to_lowercase does not get vectorized well contrary to code comments"". The term ""vectorized"" here refers to using SIMD instructions or vectorization in code. So the issue is about the function not being as efficient as expected because it's not vectorizing well.

Now, looking into the body of the issue. The user provides a microbenchmark for `to_lowercase` and uses Linux perf tooling. They observed that despite using SSE2 instructions, the code processes only 32 bytes per iteration. They included an assembly snippet showing the loop processing data in chunks, which suggests they're analyzing low-level performance, likely related to vectorization.

The user mentions that improving autovectorization isn't straightforward but proposes using `portable_simd` for explicit vectorization. They also reference another issue where `portable_simd` was used, indicating their intent is to improve the function's vectorization.

So, the main focus of the issue is on the lack of effective vectorization and a proposal to use SIMD via `portable_simd`. The label ""vector"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to vectorization issues. There's no mention of other categories like bugs or documentation; it's all about optimizing performance through better vectorization.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""vector"" is appropriate as the issue focuses on improving the function's vectorization using SIMD instructions.

- At breakpoint hover the mouse over a variable in the breakpointed function
- nothing happens

### Version of Vim

9.1.618

### Environment

### Logs and stack traces

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if the label ""hover"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue report. 

First, looking at the issue title: ""[Termdebug] balloon display evaluation of variable under mouse doesn't work."" It mentions that when hovering over a variable with the mouse in Termdebug, nothing happens. So the problem is about the hover functionality not working as expected.

In the body, the steps to reproduce involve hovering the mouse over a variable at a breakpoint, and nothing happening. The expected behavior was that it should work, which it did in previous versions. This again points to an issue with the hover feature.

Now looking at the patch provided. It changes the condition from checking for ""+balloon_eval"" or ""+balloon_eval_term"" features to just ""balloon_eval"" and ""balloon_eval_term"". This suggests that the fix was related to how Vim's balloon evaluation is being checked, which directly affects whether the hover display works.

So putting it all together: The issue is about a problem with hovering over variables not showing the expected balloon information. The patch corrects the condition that enables this feature. Therefore, labeling this as ""hover"" makes sense because the core of the problem is the malfunctioning hover functionality in Termdebug.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue, which is specifically about the hover functionality not working.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""hover"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the issue's title and body carefully.

The title is: ""[Termdebug] balloon display evaluation of variable under mouse doesn't work"". This immediately tells me that the problem is related to Termdebug and involves a balloon display when hovering over a variable with the mouse. The key elements here are ""balloon display"", ""evaluation"", and ""mouse"".

Looking at the body, the user provides steps to reproduce the issue. They mention hovering the mouse over a variable in the breakpointed function and noting that nothing happens. This indicates that the expected behavior—presumably some kind of balloon or tooltip appearing—is not happening.

The expected behavior section mentions that with Termdebug8, things work as expected. So, the problem is specific to the current setup where this feature isn't functioning.

Now, considering the label ""hover"", it directly relates to the action of hovering over a variable with the mouse. The issue revolves around what happens (or doesn't happen) when the user hovers, so the label seems appropriate because it captures the essence of the problem: an issue occurring during a hover event.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but ""hover"" is specific enough to describe this particular bug without being too broad. It accurately reflects that the problem is tied to hovering over variables in Termdebug.
</think>

The label ""hover"" correctly identifies the issue related to hovering over a variable not displaying the expected balloon information.

pytorch/pytorch,127043,bug,[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for torch.addr not checking for errors,"Discovered with <URL>

Original repro: `PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_DYNAMO=1 pytest test/test_linalg.py::TestLinalgCPU::test_addr_float_and_complex_cpu_float16`

Minimal repro:
```The code imports the `torch` library and defines a function `f` that attempts to use `torch.addr` to perform a specific tensor operation. If an exception occurs, it returns `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns the result of the operation. The function is then compiled using `torch.compile` with the ""eager"" backend. Finally, the compiled function `opt_f` is called with random tensor inputs.```

Output:
```The log shows that the script `playground3.py` traced and compiled a graph for a function `f`. The function takes three arguments `L_m_`, `L_a_`, and `L_b_` and uses them to compute a result using `torch.addr` with `beta=True` and `alpha=2`. The compilation process did not encounter any issues during tracing but failed at runtime due to an error stating that the `Boolean beta` parameter is only supported for Boolean results, which is incompatible with the use of `beta=True` in the `torch.addr` function call.```

It looks like this error occurs because the fake tensor implementation for torch.addr isn't performing all the necessary error checks.

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for torch.addr not checking for errors."" This suggests that there's an issue with how Dynamo handles error checks in the `torch.addr` function when using fake tensors. The word ""not checking"" implies something is wrong or missing, which typically points to a bug.

Next, examining the body of the issue. The user provided a minimal reproducible example and the resulting error message: ""RuntimeError: Boolean beta only supported for Boolean results."" This indicates that when `beta` is set to a boolean (like True), the function expects the result to be a boolean tensor, which isn't the case here. The fake tensor implementation in Dynamo didn't catch this error, leading to incorrect behavior.

The patches provided also shed light on what was fixed. Patch 1 removes an xfailIfTorchDynamo decorator from a test method, meaning that test was previously failing but now should pass because the issue is resolved. This suggests that the problem was related to Dynamo not handling certain cases correctly.

Patch 2 adds explicit error checks in the `addr` function for boolean values of `alpha` and `beta`. It verifies if the data types support these booleans, ensuring that errors are caught before execution. These new checks prevent the RuntimeError by validating inputs earlier.

Putting it all together: The issue describes unexpected behavior (a runtime error) due to missing error checks in Dynamo's implementation. The patches fix this by adding necessary validations and adjusting tests. This fits the definition of a bug because it's an unintended flaw in the code that causes incorrect behavior.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it involved incorrect behavior due to missing error checks, which was fixed with appropriate validations.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, looking at the title: ""[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for torch.addr not checking for errors."" The title suggests that there's an issue with how fake tensors are handling error checks in the torch.addr function within Dynamo. That sounds like a problem because if error checks aren't done properly, it could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

Now, looking at the body of the issue. It provides a detailed repro case, which is great for debugging. The user shared both an original and minimal reproduction script. When they run this code with Dynamo enabled, they get a runtime error: ""Boolean beta only supported for Boolean results."" This indicates that when using torch.addr with certain parameters (like beta=True), the fake tensor implementation in Dynamo isn't handling it correctly.

The error message suggests that the function expected a boolean result but got something else. The user's code is trying to call torch.addr with beta=True and alpha=2, which are valid parameters for this function. However, because the fake tensor isn't checking for errors properly, it throws an exception where it shouldn't, leading to incorrect handling in the compiled function.

The issue is pointing out that Dynamo's fake tensor implementation for torch.addr isn't performing necessary error checks. This means that under certain conditions, the code behaves incorrectly when compiled with Dynamo, even though it should work without issues in normal execution. 

Since this is causing an unexpected runtime error and the problem lies within Dynamo's handling of the function, it's a bug in their implementation. The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this situation because it identifies a flaw in the system that needs to be fixed.

ziglang/zig,20305,target,`std.os.linux.start_pie` is missing support for `powerpc64le`,"### Zig Version

0.13.0

### Steps to Reproduce and Observed Behavior

```The log shows that attempting to build an executable with the `powerpc64-linux` target using Zig version 0.13.0 results in two errors:
1. A missing `R_RELATIVE` definition for the target.
2. PIE (Position Independent Executable) startup is not supported for the `powerpc64-linux` target.```

### Expected Behavior

No compile error.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""target"" correctly reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""`std.os.linux.start_pie` is missing support for `powerpc64le`"". This tells me that there's a problem with the `start_pie.zig` file not supporting the powerpc64le target. The user tried to compile a Zig program using `-target powerpc64-linux` and encountered errors.

In the body, the error messages mention missing R_RELATIVE definitions and PIE startup support for the target. This indicates that when targeting powerpc64le, the necessary constants and assembly code weren't present in the `start_pie.zig` file.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a new constant `R_PPC_RELATIVE = 22;`. It also updates the switch statement to include `.powerpc`, `.powerpcle`, `.powerpc64`, and `.powerpc64le` cases, assigning them this new relative value. This directly addresses the missing R_RELATIVE definition error.

Patch 2 introduces assembly code blocks for powerpc, powerpcle, powerpc64, and powerpc64le targets. These additions provide the necessary low-level code to handle PIE startup on these architectures, which was previously unsupported and causing the compile errors.

So both patches modify `start_pie.zig` by adding support specifically for PowerPC targets. The label ""target"" is used in the context of software development often to refer to specific CPU architectures or platforms that the code needs to be compiled for. Since these changes are all about enabling support for a new target architecture (powerpc64le), the label ""target"" seems appropriate.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, and the issue is clearly about adding support for a particular target. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem and its solution.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""target"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem again.

The title of the issue says that `std.os.linux.start_pie` is missing support for `powerpc64le`. That immediately tells me that the issue is about a specific target architecture not being supported in some part of the codebase. 

Looking at the body, it provides more details. The user included steps to reproduce and the observed behavior. They tried compiling a simple Zig program with `-fPIE -target powerpc64-linux` and got two errors. The first error is about a missing `R_RELATIVE` definition for this target, and the second mentions that PIE startup isn't supported yet.

So, putting this together, the issue is clearly related to support for the PowerPC 64-bit little-endian (powerpc64le) architecture when using Position-Independent Executables (PIE). The errors indicate that the current implementation lacks necessary definitions or support for this specific target.

Now, considering the label assigned: ""target"". In GitHub issues, labels help categorize and prioritize problems. The term ""target"" could refer to build targets, compiler targets, or architecture support. Since the issue is about missing support for a particular architecture (powerpc64le), the label seems appropriate because it's directly related to target architecture support.

I don't see any other obvious labels that would fit better here. It's not a bug in the UI, nor is it a feature request beyond adding support for this target. The problem is specifically about the compiler or standard library lacking support for a certain target, which makes ""target"" a suitable label.
</think>

The issue reports missing support for a specific architecture (powerpc64le) when using PIE, indicating a problem with target support in the codebase.

First, looking at the title: ""ERROR TOCSS: failed to transform file after v0.123.1"". This suggests there's an error related to transforming a file, possibly during the build process since TOCSS is involved in processing CSS/SCSS files.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. The user is encountering two build failures. The first error is about failing to transform an SCSS file due to an undefined variable. This seems like a build-time error because it's happening when compiling or transforming assets during the site generation. The second error is a reference not found, which could relate to broken shortcodes or missing content, but again, this is causing a build failure.

The user also mentions that version 0.122.0 works fine without errors, implying that something changed in 0.123.0 or 0.123.1 that introduced these issues. They’re asking if it's due to breaking changes or a regression, which indicates they suspect a problem with the build process.

Now looking at the patches applied. Patch 1 skips a test related to config parameters on language level, which might be a workaround for a failing test, possibly caused by the same underlying issue. Patch 2 modifies how source paths are handled in the resource transformation context. It trims the prefix of the input path, which could fix issues with how files are being processed during the build.

Putting it all together, both errors mentioned are occurring during the build process (CI run) and the patches seem to address issues that affect the successful completion of builds. The label ""build"" is appropriate because it's directly related to problems arising when generating or compiling the site, which falls under build issues.
</think>

The issue report describes build failures during CI runs, and the patches address problems in the build process. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""build"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""ERROR TOCSS: failed to transform file after v0.123.1"". This immediately tells me that there's an error related to transforming a file, specifically with TOCSS. That sounds like it's part of the build process because compiling or transforming files is something that happens during builds.

Now, diving into the body of the issue. The user provided some details about their Hugo version and mentioned two specific errors they're encountering in their CI run. The first error is an undefined variable ""$pink-500"" in an SCSS file. This seems related to Sass processing, which is part of building the site's assets. The second error is a reference not found, indicating that a shortcode isn't finding the expected page. That could be related to how content is being built or processed.

The user also references a previous issue (#11455) about breaking changes in version 0.123.0 and asks if this is due to those changes or a regression. This makes me think they're wondering if it's an intentional change causing the problem or something that got introduced as a bug.

They mention that v0.122.0 works without errors, which suggests that something changed between these versions that's causing their build to fail now. The fact that the issue reproduces with the latest release indicates it's not just an isolated problem on their end.

Given all this information, the common thread is issues arising during the build process. The TOCSS error and undefined variable both relate to asset processing, which is a part of building the site. The reference error could be due to changes in how content is being built or accessed after the update.

So, putting it all together, the label ""build"" seems appropriate because the problem revolves around issues that occur when Hugo tries to build the site. Whether it's asset processing errors or content references not resolving correctly, these are all part of the build process.
</think>

The issue report describes problems occurring during the build process, specifically with TOCSS transformation and reference errors. These are directly related to building the site.

NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra,6528,bug,Decompiler erroneously swapping operators without changing the operand in floating-point comparisons where data is marked constant (x86),"**Describe the bug**
When a float variable is being compared with a double variable using one of the FCOM instructions, if the double is made constant, the comparator will flip directions, rendering the comparison incorrect.

For example:

```The code snippet checks if `x` is less than `const_1.5`. If true, it returns 0.```

will become

```The code checks if `x` is greater than 1.5 and returns 0 if true.```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Load the attached binary (I used x86:LE:32:default)
2. Make the value at address 0x0 a double
3. Make the value at address 0x8 a float
4. Observe the decompiler
5. Right-click the double in the listing view
6. Select Data -> Settings
7. Click 'normal' in the Mutability settings
8. Click constant
9. Click OK
10. Observe the decompiler again. The operands should be flipped, while the operator stays the same.

**Expected behavior**
I expected the constant to be placed last in the comparison, flipping the operands and operators as necessary to make the statement still be correct.

**Screenshots**

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Decompiler erroneously swapping operators without changing the operand in floating-point comparisons where data is marked constant (x86)"". This clearly describes a problem or flaw in how the decompiler handles certain operations when variables are marked as constants. Titles like this usually indicate issues that need fixing, which falls under bugs.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user describes a specific bug where comparing a float with a double variable using FCOM instructions causes the comparator to flip directions if the double is made constant. They provide an example showing incorrect code generation after marking a value as constant. This is a clear description of unexpected behavior, which aligns with a bug report.

The steps to reproduce are detailed and specific, which is typical for reporting bugs. The user also mentions their expected behavior, where the comparison should adjust both operands and operators correctly. Screenshots and an attachment further support this as a genuine issue rather than a feature request or other types of issues.

Looking at the patches provided: They show code changes in the SubfloatFlow class, specifically modifying how inputs are set for an operation. This indicates that a logical error was present and needed correction, which is consistent with bug fixes. The use of terms like ""preexistingGuard"" and adjusting input slots suggests they're fixing incorrect behavior related to operand ordering.

The environment details include OS, Java version, Ghidra versions, etc., which are standard for bug reports to help reproduce and identify the issue across different setups. The additional context mentions the bug occurring across multiple versions on different operating systems, reinforcing that this is an ongoing problem needing a fix.

Considering all these factors—the title describes an erroneous behavior, the body outlines the issue with examples and steps, patches correct specific code logic—it's clear that ""bug"" is the appropriate label. There’s no indication that this is a feature request, enhancement, or other category. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the report.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to determine whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the issue carefully.

The title mentions a decompiler erroneously swapping operators in floating-point comparisons when data is marked constant on x86. The body describes how comparing a float variable with a double that's made constant causes the comparator to flip directions, leading to incorrect code generation. There are steps provided to reproduce this behavior, along with expected behavior and screenshots.

The key points here are that there's unexpected behavior in the decompiler when handling certain data types under specific conditions. The user has also tested it across multiple environments and Ghidra versions, indicating it's a consistent issue rather than an isolated problem. They've provided detailed steps to reproduce, which is helpful for developers to identify and fix the problem.

The label ""bug"" is typically used to denote issues where the software behaves in an unintended way. Since this report clearly describes an unexpected behavior that affects the correctness of the decompiler's output, it fits under the category of a bug. The user also mentions their expectation of how it should work, which contrasts with what actually happens, further supporting that it's a bug.

I don't see any indication that this is a feature request or another type of issue. It's clearly an error in functionality, so the label ""bug"" seems appropriate.

denoland/deno,24589,installation,Docusaurus compatibility,"Version: Deno 1.45.2

The first:

```````The log shows that Deno is used to create a new Docusaurus project named ""my-website"" using the classic template and TypeScript support. It attempts to install dependencies via npm but fails due to a `ReferenceError` indicating that `require` is not defined. The error occurs in `exec-child.js`. Dependency installation fails, but the project directory is still created.```

- Refs <URL>

But it's likely this one requires changes on Docusaurus level to support `--package-manager=deno`.

It can be bypassed with `--skip-install`, and then the command works.

```The code snippet navigates to the `my-website` directory and installs a Deno application with future permissions, allowing scripts to be executed.```

Then:

`````The log indicates that Deno is trying to start an app but port 3000 is already in use by another process. It suggests that the current process is likely running a Docusaurus app with a specific version. The user is prompted to choose whether they want to run the app on a different port instead.```

This is a compatibility issue, because I never ran `deno task start` before. Even tried to reboot my machine and the issue persists.

But then, accepting a different port:

```The log indicates that the Docusaurus website built successfully and is running at a specified URL. However, there were warnings about invalid images and errors related to the `md4` digest method during the build process.```

Looks like one of these were already reported:

- Refs <URL>

But `Digest method not supported: md4` is new, I believe.",0,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""installation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Docusaurus compatibility"". This suggests that the issue is about Deno being compatible with Docusaurus, which is a static site generator typically used with npm and Node.js.

Now, examining the body of the issue. The user tried to create a new Docusaurus project using Deno but ran into several errors. The first error was during dependency installation, where it complained about 'require' not being defined. This indicates an issue when trying to run npm packages within Deno, possibly related to how dependencies are handled or installed.

The user provided some workarounds, like skipping the install step and using a different command to install dependencies with Deno. However, they encountered more issues when trying to start the server, including warnings about images not loading correctly and a specific error about the digest method 'md4' not being supported. They also referenced other GitHub issues related to similar problems.

The body suggests that the problem isn't just about installing packages but also about runtime compatibility and how Deno handles certain Node.js modules or dependencies that Docusaurus relies on.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies parts of the code, introducing a new `DenoDirProvider` and integrating it into various functions. This seems to adjust how node_modules are resolved, possibly to avoid conflicts with Deno's own directories.

Patches 2 adjusts the `CliFactoryServices` by removing the `deno_dir_provider` from being a separate deferred service and instead retrieving it from `cli_options`. This change likely centralizes where the provider is managed within the application.

Patches 3 through 9 are adding new files or modifying existing ones, but they seem to be test cases or setup for reproducing the issue rather than fixing core functionality. For example, Patch 3 requires 'buffer' and logs a message, which might relate to Buffer handling in Node.js modules within Deno.

Putting it all together, the patches are addressing how dependencies are fetched, node_modules are resolved, and possibly how certain Node.js-specific functionalities (like 'require') are handled within Deno. The issue is broader than just installation; it's about ensuring that Docusaurus can run correctly in a Deno environment, which involves compatibility with npm packages, module resolution, and runtime behaviors.

Therefore, while the label ""installation"" captures part of the problem, such as the initial dependency installation failure, it doesn't fully encapsulate the deeper compatibility issues. The issue is more about ensuring that Docusaurus works seamlessly with Deno beyond just installing dependencies.
</think>

The label ""installation"" doesn't fully capture the essence of the issue, which pertains to broader compatibility with Docusaurus rather than just installation problems.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""installation"" accurately reflects the issue described in this GitHub report. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""Docusaurus compatibility."" That immediately tells me the issue is about how Deno works with Docusaurus, a tool for building documentation sites.

Now, reading through the body. The user ran a command to create a new Docusaurus project using Deno. They encountered an error during dependency installation, specifically a ReferenceError saying 'require' isn't defined. That points to a problem with how dependencies are being handled, maybe related to module systems or compatibility between Deno and npm packages.

The user references another issue, #22732, which suggests that the problem might be known but needs changes in Docusaurus. They also mention that using --skip-install bypasses the initial error, allowing the command to work. Then, when trying to run the server, they get port conflicts and warnings about images not loading correctly.

Further down, there are errors about Digest method md4 not being supported. This seems like a different issue related to how files are hashed or processed during the build. They mention another issue, #23301, which again ties into broader compatibility problems between Deno and certain npm packages or tools like Docusaurus.

So, putting it all together: The main issues here seem to revolve around Deno's ability to run and integrate with Docusaurus. Problems include module resolution (require not defined), dependency installation failures, port conflicts, image loading issues, and digest method errors. These are all symptoms of compatibility problems between Deno and the project setup, specifically with how dependencies are managed and executed.

The label assigned is ""installation."" While some of the initial errors do relate to installing dependencies, the overall issue goes beyond just installation. It's about broader compatibility—how Deno handles modules, runs tasks, and processes files in a way that's expected by Docusaurus. Installation is just one part of the problem.

Therefore, while ""installation"" captures part of the issue, it doesn't cover all the aspects like runtime errors and module system incompatibilities. A more accurate label might be ""compatibility"" or something related to Deno's interaction with external tools.
</think>

The label ""installation"" doesn't fully capture the broader compatibility issues described. The problem extends beyond installation to include runtime and module system incompatibilities.

rust-lang/rust,121693,unsoundness,change `wf.rs` to use a `TypeVisitor` instead of `walk`,"we should change the following function to use a `TypeVisitor` instead of `walk` <URL>

Using a walker causes the control-flow to be a lot more complicated and given that this code is soundness-critical, we should make sure it's as easy to understand as possible








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this Rust issue where the problem is about an ""unconstrained generic constant."" The user provided some code examples that resulted in errors, and there were patches added to fix these issues.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. The error messages mention things like ""function takes 1 generic argument but 2 were supplied"" and ""unconstrained generic constant."" It seems like the compiler is having trouble with how generics are being used in const expressions or constants.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 2 adds another error message line, which suggests that the problem occurs more than once. Patch 3 modifies an error count from 5 to 6 errors, indicating that perhaps a new instance of the same issue is found, increasing the total number of errors reported.

Now, considering the labels assigned: ""unsoundness."" In Rust, unsoundness refers to situations where the type system is bypassed, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes. This can happen if there's a bug in the compiler that allows code which should be caught but isn't, violating Rust's memory safety guarantees.

The issue here seems to involve incorrect handling of generic constants, possibly leading to situations where the compiler doesn't properly constrain them, allowing invalid usages that could result in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This would indeed qualify as unsoundness because it breaks the type system's promises.

So, does the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflect this problem? Yes, because if the compiler isn't correctly constraining generic constants, it might allow code that should be rejected, potentially leading to memory safety issues or undefined behavior. Therefore, assigning the unsoundness label is appropriate.
</think>

1",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""change `wf.rs` to use a `TypeVisitor` instead of `walk`"". It suggests that the issue is about modifying code in the `wf.rs` file. The specific change is replacing the use of `walk` with `TypeVisitor`. 

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. The user provides a link to a specific line in the Rust compiler's source code, pointing out a function that needs to be changed. They mention that using a walker complicates control-flow and note that since this code is soundness-critical, it should be as easy to understand as possible.

So, the main points here are about code complexity and maintainability, especially in a part of the code that's critical for soundness. The user isn't reporting an actual unsoundness bug but rather suggesting an improvement to make soundness-critical code easier to understand and maintain.

The label ""unsoundness"" is typically used when there's a bug or issue that could lead to incorrect behavior violating Rust's safety guarantees. However, in this case, the issue isn't about a bug causing unsoundness; it's more about improving the code structure to prevent potential future issues by reducing complexity.

Therefore, applying the ""unsoundness"" label here might be misleading because the problem described is about code quality and maintainability rather than an actual soundness vulnerability or bug.
</think>

The issue report focuses on improving code structure for maintainability in a soundness-critical area rather than addressing an actual unsoundness bug. The label ""unsoundness"" doesn't fit here as it refers to potential safety issues, not code quality improvements.

vim/vim,14490,encoding,"Vim clone left ""dirty"" after make. src/po/ru.cp1251.po is modified.","### Steps to reproduce

I occasionally see this, and I think I've seen mention of this on the dev list; it might always be the same file; this morning I happened to catch it just after it happened. I also built yesterday morning. It doesn't happen too often (the revert file I see is from January), I haven't looked at makefiles, I don't know what dependency is triggering.

If anyone knows something specific to check...

After pull, make reconfig, the console shows the make ending as:
```The log shows the process of compiling translation files into MO format using `msgfmt` for various languages and character sets. It also includes steps to convert and update the Russian translation file (`ru.po`) to create a new file (`ru.cp1251.po`). The final line indicates that the status of the working directory shows changes in the Russian translation file.```

The diff seems to be a lot of formatting. Here's an excerpt, as seen in vim.
```````The log entry shows a change from using `Äëÿ ðàáîòû ñ àðàáñêîé ïèñüìåííîñòüþ ââåäèòå êîìàíäó :set` with no encoding specification to `Äëÿ ðàáîòû ñ àðàáñêîé ïèñüìåííîñòüþ ââåäèòå êîìàíäó :set encoding=utf-8`.```
It interesting that the wrap, as shown in vim above, is happening right around column 80. With all these formatting changes it's hard to see if there are any real changes.

Using `gvim -d` to look at the checked in file and the it looks like the only changes are around the linebreak and that the translation itself has no changes.

Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""encoding"" accurately reflects the provided issue report and its associated patches. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: it's about character encoding issues in various languages. The problem seems to be with how text is displayed, possibly due to incorrect encoding settings.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. It describes specific errors when running certain commands in Vim, like incorrect characters for non-ASCII text and garbled output. This definitely points towards an encoding problem because incorrect encodings often cause such display issues.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 changes the encoding from 'cp1250' to 'CP1250'. The capitalization might matter in some systems, so this is related to encoding settings.

Patch 2 does something similar for 'big5', changing it to 'BIG5'. Again, this is about character encoding.

The other patches (3, 4, 5) adjust various lines across different files. For example, in patch 3, they fix the charset in a comment line from lowercase to uppercase. In patch 4 and 5, similar changes are made for Slovak and Taiwanese language files, adjusting the Content-Type header's charset parameter.

All these patches are tweaking how encoding is specified in the files, which directly relates to character encoding issues.

So, putting it all together: the issue revolves around incorrect or inconsistent encoding settings causing display problems. The patches correct these by standardizing the encoding identifiers, ensuring they're properly recognized.

Therefore, the label ""encoding"" accurately reflects this problem because the core of the issue and its solution are about how text is encoded and displayed.
</think>

The label ""encoding"" is appropriate because the issue and patches address character encoding problems affecting text display in Vim. The changes correct encoding specifications to resolve display issues.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""encoding"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Vim clone left 'dirty' after make. src/po/ru.cp1251.po is modified."" This indicates that a file related to Russian translations in CP1251 encoding is being modified unexpectedly during the build process. So, there's a mention of an encoding here (CP1251).

Now, examining the body: The user describes steps where after running make, a specific PO file (ru.cp1251.po) is modified. They provided logs showing that this file is generated from ru.po using iconv to convert from UTF-8 to CP1251 and then processed with sed for charset replacement. 

The diff shows changes in line wrapping around column 80, but the user notes that the actual translations haven't changed. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the encoding is handled during the build process, causing unexpected modifications.

The expected behavior is that no checked-in file should be modified, implying that something in the build or file handling is causing this change. The presence of encoding conversions (UTF-8 to CP1251) and specific charset replacements points directly to an encoding-related issue.

Given all these points, the label ""encoding"" accurately captures the essence of the problem since it revolves around how files are encoded and processed during compilation.
</think>

The label ""encoding"" is appropriate because the issue involves problems with file encoding conversion (UTF-8 to CP1251) causing unexpected modifications.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""SimpleBlocksIT.testAddBlockWhileDeletingIndices failing"". This clearly indicates that a test case is failing. Test failures often point to bugs in the code because if a test passes before and starts failing, it suggests something changed that introduced an issue.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. There's a CI link which shows where the failure occurred. The repro line gives specific commands to reproduce the problem, which helps in diagnosing it. It mentions whether the issue reproduces reliably, which is ""Didn't try"", so maybe the reporter didn't test it manually but the CI did catch it. 

The ""Failure history"" is empty, meaning this might be a new issue or at least not one that's been recurring for a while. The failure excerpt shows an AssertionError with the message ""executed already"". That suggests some action was attempted to be performed more than once when it shouldn't have been. The stack trace points to specific parts of the code where listeners are handling failures, which might indicate race conditions or incorrect state management.

Looking at the patches provided, they seem to adjust how certain listeners and actions are handled in the code. For instance, replacing some anonymous listener implementations with lambda expressions using ActionListener.run(). This kind of change is typical when dealing with concurrency issues or ensuring that operations happen in the correct order. The error message about ""executed already"" implies that an action was attempted twice, so restructuring how these listeners are set up could prevent that.

The patches also involve wrapping some operations within run() methods and adjusting how exceptions are handled. This is often done to ensure proper synchronization or to avoid reentrant code paths that might cause the same action to execute multiple times unintentionally.

Given all this, the issue seems to be a bug because it's causing a test failure due to an unexpected exception. The patches address the root cause by restructuring how asynchronous operations are handled, likely fixing a race condition or incorrect state management leading to the ""executed already"" error.

So yes, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue as it involves unexpected behavior that was addressed with code changes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate because the issue describes a test failure due to an AssertionError caused by an unexpected exception. The patches address potential concurrency issues leading to the error, indicating a bug in the code.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me look at the details provided.

The title of the issue is ""SimpleBlocksIT.testAddBlockWhileDeletingIndices failing."" That immediately tells me that a test case is failing. The body includes a CI link, which probably points to where this failure occurred in continuous integration. 

Looking further down, there's a section on how to reproduce the issue with a specific Gradle command. This suggests that the problem can be consistently replicated, which is a hallmark of a bug because it's not just a one-off glitch.

The ""Does it reproduce?"" section says ""Didn't try,"" but I'm assuming that if the test is failing in CI, it should be reproducible there at least. 

Next, under ""Applicable branches,"" it mentions ""main."" So this issue is affecting the main branch of the codebase, which indicates it's a current problem and not something from an old version.

The failure history isn't provided, so I can't tell if this is a new issue or a recurring one. However, the key part is the stack trace in the ""Failure excerpt."" It shows an AssertionError with the message ""[...] executed already,"" which points to some code trying to run an action that's already been executed. 

The error occurs in testAddBlockWhileDeletingIndices, and from the stack trace, it seems related to Elasticsearch's replication actions and ActionListener implementations. The fact that there's a specific exception being thrown suggests this isn't just a flaky test but an actual bug where certain conditions cause unexpected behavior.

Additionally, there are warnings about deprecated Java methods, specifically System::setSecurityManager. While these are warnings rather than errors, they might indicate that the code is using outdated practices which could lead to other issues down the line. However, the primary problem here is the test failure due to an AssertionError.

Putting this together: a failing test in CI with a clear error message pointing to specific actions and listeners, along with a reproducible scenario, all point towards this being a bug rather than, say, a feature request or an enhancement. There's no indication that this is a user error or something else; the issue seems to be with the code itself.

So yes, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this report because it describes a defect in the codebase that causes a test failure under certain conditions.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate for this issue since it involves a failing test case with a clear error message and reproducible steps.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""[Zone.js] `it.failing` and `test.failing` seem to be not patched for `Jest`"". That suggests there's an issue with Zone.js not handling certain Jest methods correctly, specifically the failing modifiers for it and test. 

Looking at the body, the user reports a TypeError: ""it.failing is not a function."" This error occurred when running tests, which indicates that during execution, the method it.failing wasn't recognized as a function. The problem was traced back to Zone.js not supporting these modifiers, and the issue was reproduced in a minimal setup.

The patches provided show that they added context[methodName].failing = (originalJestFn as any).failing; which means they were attaching the failing method to both it and test. So before this patch, when someone used it.failing or test.failing, Zone.js didn't properly handle these, leading to the runtime error.

The label assigned is ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically occurs during the execution of the program, not at compile time. In this case, the TypeError happens when Jest runs the tests, which fits the definition of a runtime error because it's an exception thrown during execution.

So putting it all together: The issue was causing a runtime error because Zone.js wasn't properly patching the failing methods for Jest, leading to a TypeError when those methods were called. The patches fixed this by ensuring the failing methods are correctly assigned, thus resolving the runtime error.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves an exception occurring during test execution due to unpatched methods in Zone.js.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue described. Let me read through the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is ""[Zone.js] `it.failing` and `test.failing` seem to be not patched for `Jest`"". This suggests that there's an issue with Zone.js related to Jest, specifically about certain methods or properties (`it.failing` and `test.failing`) not being properly patched. 

Looking at the body of the issue, it mentions that the problem was originally reported in another repository, jest-preset-angular, where the user encountered a TypeError: ""it.failing is not a function"". This error occurred when using Zone.js with Jest, indicating that during runtime, `it.failing` wasn't recognized as a function. 

The body also provides a minimal reproduction link and environment details, which includes the versions of Angular CLI, Node, and Zone.js (0.14.10). The user provided the error message as a code snippet, clearly showing a TypeError at runtime.

The label in question is ""runtime error"". A runtime error occurs during the execution of the program, unlike syntax or compile-time errors. In this case, the issue arises when the test runs, and Zone.js isn't correctly patching `it.failing` and `test.failing`, leading to a TypeError.

So, considering all this, the problem is indeed a runtime error because it occurs during execution when Jest tries to run the tests. The TypeError is a clear indicator of an issue happening at runtime.

denoland/deno,22883,panic,"""Deno has panicked"" error","I encountered an error when I trying debug Typescript with VScode Insider at the Raspberry Pi 4(4GB model)...

Debuged file:
```The code snippet is a TypeScript file that logs 'hoge' to the console.```

Debug Console Error:
```The log indicates that the Deno application attempted to run but encountered several issues:

1. The `--unstable` flag is deprecated and will be removed in Deno 2.0; use specific unstable flags instead.
2. The inspector server could not start due to an address already being in use (error code 98).
3. Deno panicked, indicating a bug, and the user is instructed to report it.

6. The process exited with code 1.```
Version: Deno 1.41.2
",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Deno has panicked"" error. The word ""panicked"" directly indicates a panic occurred in Deno, which aligns with the label ""panic"".

Next, examining the body of the issue. The user encountered an error while trying to debug TypeScript with VSCode on a Raspberry Pi 4. The debug console shows several messages, including ""Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno."" Additionally, there's a stack trace mentioning a panic in the 'main' thread due to an error when trying to unwrap a Result, which caused the process to exit with code 1. All these details point towards a panic issue.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Each patch seems to address error handling around the inspector server setup. For example:

- Patch 1 changes `resolve_inspector_server` to return a Result, allowing proper error handling instead of panicking.
- Patches 2 and 4 modify functions to handle errors gracefully by returning them instead of unwrapping, which would cause panics.
- Patch 6 modifies the creation of InspectorServer to use proper error handling with `Result`, preventing panics when binding the TCP listener.

These patches indicate that the original issue was indeed a panic caused by improper error handling. By adjusting the code to handle errors without unwrapping or assuming success, the patches prevent the panic from occurring.

Considering all these points—the title, body details, and the nature of the fixes—it's clear that the label ""panic"" is appropriate because it directly addresses the root cause described in the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Deno has panicked"" error. The word ""panicked"" directly indicates that a panic occurred in Deno, which is a critical runtime error in Rust (and other languages) where the program crashes due to an unrecoverable condition.

Now, examining the body of the issue. The user describes encountering an error while trying to debug TypeScript with VSCode on a Raspberry Pi 4. They provided a simple TypeScript file that just logs 'hoge', so the code itself isn't likely causing the panic. 

In the debug console output, there's a deprecation warning about the --unstable flag. But more importantly, it shows an error: ""Cannot start inspector server: Os (code: 98, kind: AddrInUse, message: 'Address already in use')"". This suggests that the port needed for the inspector was already occupied, preventing Deno from starting its debugging server.

Following this, there's a clear panic message: ""Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno."" The error indicates that the program couldn't handle the situation gracefully and crashed, which aligns with what a panic is—a runtime error that causes termination.

Additionally, the backtrace points to `inspector_server.rs` where a `TrySendError` occurred because of a disconnected state. This suggests an issue within Deno's inspector server code when trying to send messages, leading to the panic.

The environment variables and version information are provided, which is helpful for debugging but doesn't change the fact that a panic occurred.

The assigned label ""panic"" directly relates to both the title and body, as the problem revolves around Deno encountering a panic state due to an error it couldn't recover from.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""[CI] EsqlSpecIT test {lookup-join.LookupMessageFromIndexKeepReordered ASYNC} failing"". It mentions a specific test failure in a CI environment. The test name suggests it's related to some ES SQL functionality, maybe involving lookups or joins.

Moving on to the body. The user provided several build scans and a reproduction line, which is helpful for debugging. They also mention that this doesn't reproduce locally, so it's probably an issue specific to the CI setup or environment.

The failure message shows an AssertionError due to data mismatches in rows and columns. For example, expected ""Success"" but got ""Disconnected"", and some IP addresses and numbers don't match. This indicates that during testing, the test expected certain values, but the actual results were different. It's a test assertion error, so the test is failing because of incorrect data outputs.

Now looking at the patches applied to fix this issue. Patch 1 seems to remove specific test cases related to EsqlSpecIT. Maybe those tests were causing flakiness and needed to be adjusted or removed. Patch 2 adds ""ignoreOrder:true"" in the test, which probably makes the test ignore the order of results. This could mean that without considering the order, the data mismatch might not occur because the test was previously failing due to unexpected ordering.

So, why is the label ""runtime error""? A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, like exceptions or crashes. However, in this case, it's an assertion failure in a test. The tests are failing because of data mismatches, not because there was a crash or exception from the code itself.

The issue is more about the test expecting certain values but getting others, which suggests a problem with either the test setup, environment, or maybe the way the data is being handled. It's a test failure due to incorrect results rather than an actual runtime error in the application.

So, I think the label ""runtime error"" might not be accurate here because it's specifically about a failing test case rather than an error occurring during the execution of the code outside of testing. The correct labels should probably relate to test failures or data mismatches.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect this issue, which is about a test failure due to data mismatches rather than an actual runtime exception.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let me read through the provided information carefully.

The issue's title is ""[CI] EsqlSpecIT test {lookup-join.LookupMessageFromIndexKeepReordered ASYNC} failing"". This suggests that a specific test in the CI pipeline is failing. The mention of ""ASYNC"" indicates it's an asynchronous test.

Looking at the body, there are several sections:

1. **Build Scans:** These link to specific Gradle Enterprise builds, which show where the failures occurred.
2. **Reproduction Line:** A command to run the test that's failing, specifying the method and some system properties like Java version.
3. **Applicable branches:** Only main is affected.
4. **Reproduces locally?:** N/A, so it might not be easily reproducible outside of CI.
5. **Failure History:** Links to a dashboard showing the failure rate over time.
6. **Failure Message:** Details an AssertionError with data mismatches in expected vs actual values across multiple rows and columns.

The issue reasons mention that there are 3 failures in the specific test, part3 step, and pipeline, each with their fail rates.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, such as exceptions, crashes, or unexpected behavior. The failure here is due to an AssertionError, which indicates that certain conditions in the test weren't met. The tests are failing because the data doesn't match expectations, showing discrepancies like ""Success"" vs ""Disconnected"", different IP addresses, and varying numerical values.

The root cause seems to be related to how the data is being handled during the test execution—perhaps an issue with asynchronous operations, network connections, or data retrieval. However, this isn't a typical runtime error like a NullPointerException or IndexOutOfBoundsException but rather a test assertion failure.

In software development contexts, test failures due to assertions are often labeled as ""test failure"" or ""bug,"" not necessarily ""runtime error."" Runtime errors usually refer to exceptions thrown during execution rather than failing test cases. Therefore, while the issue does involve an error occurring when the tests run, labeling it as a runtime error might not be precise because the problem is with the test assertions rather than an unexpected crash or exception in the code.

So, I would say that the label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect this issue report since it's more about a failing test due to data mismatches rather than a runtime exception.

rust-lang/rust,133388,type system,Check for `dyn` providing all of its projections is incomplete w.r.t. different supertrait substitutions,"I tried this code:

```The code defines traits `Sup` and `Dyn` in Rust. It implements trait `Sup` for unit type `()`, where the associated type `Assoc` is `T`. It also implements trait `Dyn` for `()`. In the `main` function, it creates a variable `q` of type `Default` for the associated type `Assoc` of the dynamically dispatched trait object `dyn Dyn<i32, u32>` constrained to satisfy `Sup<u32>`.```

I expected to see this happen: It errors b/c we don't know what the associated type for `<dyn Dyn<i32, u32> as Sup<u32>>::Assoc` is.

Instead, this happened: Codegen ICE.

</p>
</details>
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""type system"" is accurate for this issue report. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The issue seems to be about errors related to associated types in Rust. From the patches, it looks like there were changes made to how error messages are displayed when associated types aren't specified properly. For example, in some test cases, the error message now includes more specific information about where the associated type is missing, including generics.

I remember that in Rust, associated types are a part of trait definitions and can be thought of as a way for traits to have their own types. So when you use a trait with dynamic dispatch (like using `dyn Trait`), you sometimes need to specify these associated types because the compiler might not be able to infer them automatically.

Looking at Patch 3, there's an error message change from ""Output in Div"" to ""Output in Div<Rhs>"". This indicates that the error now includes the generic parameter, making it clearer where exactly the problem is. Similarly, other patches adjust the error messages to include more specific type information.

The issue seems to be about improving how the compiler reports errors related to missing associated types, especially when dealing with traits and generics. So, this definitely falls under the category of the type system because it's about how Rust handles and reports issues with types during compilation.

The label ""type system"" would encompass errors related to type checking, trait systems, and associated types. Since all these changes are about enhancing error reporting for associated types in traits, which is a fundamental part of Rust's type system, the label seems appropriate.

I don't see any parts of this issue that would relate more to another label like ""syntax"" or ""compiler frontend."" It's specifically about how the compiler handles and reports type-related errors, so ""type system"" fits best.
</think>

The label ""type system"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue, which deals with associated types and error reporting within Rust's trait system. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""type system"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided information.

First, looking at the title: ""Check for `dyn` providing all of its projections is incomplete w.r.t. different supertrait substitutions."" Hmm, that sounds a bit technical but seems to relate to how dynamic dispatch (using `dyn`) handles trait projections and substitutions in Rust. Trait projections have to do with associated types and their resolution, which is definitely part of the type system.

Now, looking at the body of the issue. The user provided some Rust code. They defined traits `Sup` and `Dyn`, implemented them for the unit type `()`, and then tried to use an associated type from a dynamic trait object in `main()`. The expected behavior was a compiler error because the associated type couldn't be determined, but instead, the compiler crashed with an ICE (Internal Compiler Error). 

The code involves traits, associated types, and dynamic dispatch. All of these are core features of Rust's type system. The issue seems to be about how the compiler handles these type-related constructs when they're used in certain ways, especially involving `dyn` which is a keyword for dynamic trait objects.

The backtrace provided shows that the panic occurred during instance resolution, specifically in `instance.rs`, which deals with how the compiler resolves trait implementations and associated items. This again points to an issue within the type system's handling of traits and their projections.

So, considering all this, the problem revolves around how the Rust type system manages dynamic trait objects and their associated types across different supertrait substitutions. The label ""type system"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to how the compiler processes and resolves these type-related constructs.

I don't see any other primary aspect like a bug in the standard library, concurrency issues, or syntax problems here. It's all about the type checking and resolution mechanisms failing unexpectedly, leading to an ICE instead of a proper error message.
</think>

The issue revolves around dynamic trait objects and associated type resolution, which are integral parts of Rust's type system. The problem causes a compiler crash during instance resolution, indicating a flaw in how the type system handles these constructs.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42742,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring GraphQL 1.3.3,,1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. The issue's title is ""Upgrade to Spring GraphQL 1.3.3"", which suggests they're updating a dependency version. 

Looking at the patches provided, there's a change in the library version from ""1.3.3-SNAPSHOT"" to ""1.3.3"". This indicates they're moving from a snapshot (which is usually a development version) to a stable release. That definitely sounds like a dependency upgrade because they're updating the version of an external library they're using.

The body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context, but the title and the patch clearly show a version change for Spring GraphQL. So the label ""dependency upgrade"" makes sense here.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue. The issue has a title but an empty body. 

First, looking at the title: ""Upgrade to Spring GraphQL 1.3.3"". Upgrading usually implies moving from one version of a dependency to another, which would fall under a dependency upgrade. Even though the body is empty, the title suggests they're updating their project's dependencies.

I don't see any conflicting information here. Since the action mentioned is an upgrade, and it's related to Spring GraphQL, which is likely a dependency in their project, the label makes sense.
</think>

The issue title clearly indicates an intention to update a dependency, so the label ""dependency upgrade"" is appropriate.

cc @mcarilli @ezyang @eellison @peterbell10",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[compiled autograd][cudagraphs] TLS is gc'd between unit test cudagraph runs."" It mentions that the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) for cudagraphs is being garbage collected between test runs. That immediately suggests an issue related to how resources are managed in memory during runtime, especially since it's happening across multiple tests.

Next, the body of the issue provides more context. The user describes a bug where running several local tests involving cudagraphs causes the TLS to be garbage collected. They even provided a reproduction command using pytest, pointing to specific test functions. This indicates that the problem occurs during the execution of these tests, which is definitely a runtime behavior.

Looking at the patches applied, there's an addition in the code where they import `torch._inductor.cudagraph_trees` inside a context manager. The comment mentions importing it lazily due to circular dependencies and ensuring that it's available when needed. This change seems aimed at preserving the TLS by making sure the necessary modules are properly imported and not garbage collected prematurely.

The assigned label is ""runtime,"" which typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the code, as opposed to build-time or compile-time errors. Since this problem manifests while running tests (a runtime activity) and the fix involves ensuring modules are correctly loaded at runtime to prevent premature garbage collection, it makes sense.

I don't see any indications that this is a bug related to the build process, compiler errors, or anything outside of execution time. Therefore, ""runtime"" seems appropriate here.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down whether the label ""runtime"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the title: ""[compiled autograd][cudagraphs] TLS is gc'd between unit test cudagraph runs."" It mentions that the TLS (Thread-Local Storage) related to CUDA graphs is being garbage collected between test runs. This suggests an issue with how resources are managed during execution.

In the body, the user describes a bug where running multiple tests causes the CUDA graph TLS to be garbage collected, leading to problems. They provided a repro steps and some debugging output showing that `local.tree_manager_locks` becomes a weakref after the first test, indicating it's been cleaned up by the garbage collector.

The versions mentioned are main and A100, which points to hardware and software specifics but doesn't change the nature of the issue.

Now, considering the label ""runtime."" Runtime issues typically refer to problems that occur during the execution of the program, such as crashes, performance issues, or incorrect behavior. In this case, the TLS being garbage collected between tests affects the runtime environment because it's causing unexpected behavior when running multiple tests sequentially.

Alternative labels could be ""memory management"" or ""testing,"" but since the problem arises during the execution phase and relates to resource management affecting test runs, ""runtime"" seems appropriate as it captures the essence of an issue occurring while the code is executing.
</think>

The label ""runtime"" accurately reflects the issue because it pertains to a problem occurring during program execution related to resource management.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""content length"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is: ""TextInput maximum length limit does not work in old architecture for iOS."" That tells me that the problem is specifically with the maxLength property of a TextInput component in React Native, and it's not functioning correctly on iOS when using the old architecture. 

Looking at the body, the user provided steps to reproduce the issue. They created a new app with RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0, which means they're using the old architecture. They added a TextInput with maxLength set to 5, but it didn't work as expected. They also specified that this affects iOS and provided their React Native version as 0.76.1.

The environment info shows they're on macOS with Xcode 16.1, which is up-to-date, and the new architecture is disabled for iOS, which aligns with the problem description.

There's no stacktrace or logs, but the user mentions that it works in Snack, so maybe it's an environment-specific issue related to the old architecture.

Now looking at the patch provided. It changes a line in the Objective-C code where the condition checks if text.length is greater than _maxLength.integerValue. The patch modifies this to use allowedLength instead of directly accessing _maxLength. So, the fix involves how maxLength is handled in the TextInput component for iOS in the old architecture.

The label assigned was ""content length."" I need to determine if that's accurate. The issue is about the maxLength feature not working, which relates to limiting the content length of a text input. However, the problem isn't just about content length in general but specifically about how maxLength is implemented and enforced in the old architecture on iOS.

I'm thinking that while ""content length"" does touch on the aspect of maxLength, it's a bit broad. The issue is more specific to the functionality of maxLength not working, which could be labeled as a bug or a feature-specific problem rather than just content length. However, since maxLength directly relates to limiting content length, maybe ""content length"" is appropriate.

But wait, maybe there's a better label like ""maxlength"" or ""textinput"" that more precisely captures the issue. Alternatively, ""bug"" could be another option if it's about functionality not working as intended. But in this case, the label given is ""content length,"" which does relate to maxLength. So I think it's somewhat accurate because maxLength is about limiting the content's length.

Therefore, after considering all parts—the title, body, steps to reproduce, environment details, and the specific patch—it seems that the label ""content length"" does reflect the issue, even though it might not be the most specific term possible. It's still relevant enough to describe the problem at hand.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has provided an issue report from GitHub about React Native where the TextInput's maxLength isn't working on iOS when using the old architecture. They want to know if the label ""content length"" is appropriate.

First, I'll look at the title: ""TextInput maximum length limit does not work in old architecture for iOS."" The key here is that the maxLength property isn't functioning as expected. This property is meant to restrict the number of characters a user can input, so it's about limiting content length.

Now, looking at the body, they provide steps to reproduce which involve setting maxLength=""5"" and running on an environment where RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0, meaning the old architecture is in use. They've also specified that this happens on iOS with React Native version 0.76.1. The logs don't show any errors, but the problem is clearly about the maxLength not being enforced.

The assigned label is ""content length."" That makes sense because the issue revolves around the maximum allowed content in a text input. Even though the problem is specific to the old architecture on iOS, the core of the issue is related to the functionality of controlling the length of user input, which is exactly what ""content length"" refers to.

So, yes, the label accurately reflects the issue because it directly relates to the maxLength feature not working, which is a content length limitation. There's no mention of other aspects like UI or performance, so ""content length"" is spot on.
</think>

The label ""content length"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to the maxLength property of TextInput not functioning correctly.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part tells me.

The title of the issue is ""[CI] MultiClusterSpecIT test {date.DocsDateFormat} failing"". The [CI] prefix suggests that this issue is related to Continuous Integration, which typically involves automated testing and builds. That's a hint that the label might be correct since CI issues usually pertain to failures in the build or test pipeline.

Looking at the body of the issue, it provides details about build scans with links to Gradle Enterprise, which is a tool used for CI/CD. The reproduction line shows a specific Gradle command that's failing when running tests, specifically pointing to a test method called ""test {date.DocsDateFormat}"". This indicates that the failure occurs during automated testing in the CI environment.

The issue also mentions ""Reproduces locally?: N/A"", which suggests it might not be easily reproducible outside of the CI setup. The failure history and the links provided point to dashboards tracking test failures, further indicating this is a problem within their CI system.

Now looking at the patches that resolved the issue: There are three patches. 

Patch 1 modifies a test configuration file, removing certain tests related to date formatting. This could mean that those specific tests were causing failures in the CI pipeline, so they were disabled or fixed.

Patches 2 and 3 add warning messages about JDK 23 changing how week-date field specifiers are handled. These patches seem to address issues in the code where date formats might be incompatible with upcoming Java versions. By adding these warnings, the tests can now pass because they account for the expected changes, or perhaps the failing assertions were due to these date format issues.

Putting it all together: The issue is about a test failure in the CI environment related to date formatting that's affected by JDK 23 changes. The patches address this by either modifying tests or adding warnings about deprecated formats. Since the problem originated from CI tests and was resolved through code changes, labeling it as ""ci"" makes sense because it pertains to the automated testing infrastructure.

Therefore, the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""ci"" is appropriate for this issue since it involves test failures within the Continuous Integration environment, specifically related to date formatting issues that were addressed through code patches. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ci"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on its title and body. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The title of the issue is ""[CI] MultiClusterSpecIT test {date.DocsDateFormat} failing"". The brackets around CI immediately catch my eye—this likely stands for Continuous Integration, which relates to automated testing and build processes. So that's a hint that it's related to CI issues.

Looking at the body, there are several sections. The first part lists ""Build Scans"" with links to Gradle Enterprise, which is a tool used in CI/CD pipelines. Each link has terms like ""elasticsearch-intake"" and ""pull-request"", which suggests these are build jobs or test runs that might be failing.

Next, under ""Reproduction Line,"" there's a command using `gradlew`, which is a Gradle wrapper script often used in build processes. The command includes parameters for running specific tests, setting seeds, locales, timezones, etc. This seems like instructions to reproduce the failing test, which is something you'd do when debugging CI issues.

The ""Applicable branches"" section mentions ""main"", indicating this issue affects the main branch of the codebase. Then there's a note that it doesn't reproduce locally, which implies that the problem occurs in the CI environment but not on developers' machines—another sign of a CI-related issue.

The ""Failure History"" links to a dashboard with statistics about test failures over time. Dashboards like this are typically used in CI/CD to monitor build and test health. The URL suggests it's part of an internal tool or system the team uses for tracking such metrics.

Moving on, the ""Failure Message"" shows an `AssertionError` related to date formatting in JDK 23. The error message mentions that week-date field specifiers are changing, which could indicate a problem with how dates are handled in tests when run under CI, perhaps due to environment differences like Java versions or locale settings.

Under ""Issue Reasons,"" there are multiple points about consecutive failures in specific tests and steps within the pipeline. Terms like ""step 8.16.0_bwc-snapshots"" and ""pipeline elasticsearch-intake/pull-request"" suggest these are parts of a CI/CD pipeline where the test is failing repeatedly. The mention of failure rates further supports that this is an issue with how tests are performing in automated builds.

Finally, the note says the issue was created using new test triage automation, which implies it's part of their CI process to automatically report failing tests. They also ask for feedback on the system, which is typical when refining CI/CD pipelines and their reporting mechanisms.

Putting this all together: The title explicitly mentions CI, the body details build scans, Gradle commands, pipeline steps, test failures in automated environments, and references CI-specific tools like dashboards and automation. All these elements are strongly related to Continuous Integration issues—problems that occur during automated builds or tests rather than local development.

Therefore, assigning the label ""ci"" is appropriate because it accurately reflects that the issue pertains to problems within their CI pipeline, such as failing tests in automated environments.

Lighthouse warns about the use of legacy transformations, from <URL>

By the look of today's browser support for ES6 Class <URL> it seems like we should be able to remove this from the default Babel plugin configuration and leave it to be added opt-in by developers. At least, if not for the next major release, in the next few months.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

Starting with the title: ""Remove @babel/plugin-transform-classes"". This clearly mentions a Babel plugin, so that's relevant.

Looking at the body, the user discusses removing a specific Babel plugin because it's no longer necessary due to browser support for ES6 classes. They reference Lighthouse warnings about legacy transformations and suggest making this change in the next release or months. The issue affects performance and runtime areas across various stages like development and deployment. 

The patches provided show that they modified the Babel configuration, specifically around plugins. They added comments explaining that certain class-related plugins are conditionally enabled based on user options or browser support.

Considering all these points, the issue is about modifying how a specific Babel plugin is handled in Next.js's build process. The label ""plugin"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to changes made to Babel plugins within the project configuration.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the title and body carefully.

The title is ""Remove @babel/plugin-transform-classes"". This clearly refers to a Babel plugin, specifically the transform-classes plugin. So right away, it's about a plugin.

Looking at the body, the user provides a link to a specific line in a file where this plugin is included. They mention that including the plugin is current behavior but they expect it to be removed. The issue seems to be about whether this particular Babel plugin should still be part of the default configuration.

They also provide environment information and areas affected, listing Performance and Runtime, which makes sense because removing a plugin could affect how code is transformed and thus impact performance.

The stages affected include various Next.js commands like dev, build, start, and deployment on Vercel. So this change would have broad implications across different environments where the code runs.

In the additional context, they reference a Lighthouse report warning about legacy transformations. They link to the specific part of the Lighthouse code that checks for this. The user argues that since modern browsers support ES6 classes, the plugin might no longer be necessary and could be removed, allowing developers to opt-in if needed.

Throughout all this, the focus is on a specific Babel plugin—whether to remove it from the default configuration. So the issue revolves around the use of a plugin, its necessity, and its impact on performance and compatibility.

The label ""plugin"" seems appropriate because the entire discussion is about managing a Babel plugin within Next.js's build process. There's no mention of other aspects like bugs, features, or documentation; it's strictly about modifying the set of plugins used.

Therefore, assigning the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the content of this issue report.

pytorch/pytorch,131084,ci,DISABLED test_invalid_port (__main__.TCPStoreTest),"Platforms: linux

This test was disabled because it is failing in CI. See [recent examples](<URL> and the most recent trunk [workflow logs](<URL>

Over the past 3 hours, it has been determined flaky in 19 workflow(s) with 19 failures and 19 successes.

**Debugging instructions (after clicking on the recent samples link):**
DO NOT ASSUME THINGS ARE OKAY IF THE CI IS GREEN. We now shield flaky tests from developers so CI will thus be green but it will be harder to parse the logs.
To find relevant log snippets:
1. Click on the workflow logs linked above
2. Click on the Test step of the job so that it is expanded. Otherwise, the grepping will not work.
3. Grep for `test_invalid_port`

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""ci"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem says.

First, looking at the title: it's about disabling a test called test_invalid_port in TCPStoreTest. The body explains that the test was disabled because it's flaky and failing in CI. They provided links to logs and some stats on how often it fails and passes. There are instructions for debugging, which mentions looking into workflow logs where this test is flaky.

The patches show that the test method test_invalid_port was removed from the codebase. So, they stopped running this test because it was causing CI issues.

Now, what's a ""ci"" label usually used for? Typically, in GitHub issues, the ""ci"" label refers to problems related to continuous integration, such as failing tests, flaky tests, or build issues on the CI pipelines.

In this case, the issue is about a test being disabled because it was causing CI failures. The problem was identified through CI logs and workflow runs. The solution was to remove the problematic test to prevent CI from failing.

So, does the ""ci"" label fit here? Yes, because the entire issue revolves around the test causing instability in the CI system. The problem is directly related to continuous integration, as it's about a flaky test affecting the build processes.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
</think>

The label ""ci"" accurately reflects the issue since it pertains to a flaky test causing CI failures.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""ci"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the title and body carefully.

The title says: ""DISABLED test_invalid_port (__main__.TCPStoreTest)"". So it mentions that a specific test was disabled. The body provides more context, stating that the test was disabled because it's failing in CI. It also includes links to examples of recent failures and workflow logs, which suggests that this is related to continuous integration processes.

In the body, there are details about the test being flaky, with 19 workflow instances showing both failures and successes. There are instructions on how to debug using the provided links, including steps like expanding the test step in the job and grepping for the test name. This all points towards issues within the CI system.

Additionally, the error message is an AssertionError indicating that a RuntimeError wasn't raised as expected. The file path is given, along with some commands on how to run the test manually. The mentions of setting environment variables like PYTORCH_PRINT_REPRO_ON_FAILURE also relate to debugging in a CI context.

The issue also cc's several people, likely maintainers or experts in that area, which is common when needing help with flaky tests in CI pipelines.

So, putting it all together, the report is about a test failing in CI, making it flaky and thus disabled. All the information ties back to continuous integration issues—problems encountered during automated testing runs on the CI server.
</think>

The label ""ci"" accurately reflects this issue as it pertains to a test failure within the continuous integration environment.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39950,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring HATEOAS 2.2.1,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Spring HATEOAS 2.2.1"". That immediately tells me that this is about updating a dependency. The specific mention of upgrading from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 in the patches also supports this.

Next, examining the patches provided, there's only one patch shown. It modifies a line in what looks like a build configuration file (maybe a Gradle or Maven pom file). The change is from version ""2.2.0"" to ""2.2.1"". This clearly indicates that the issue was resolved by updating the dependency version.

The body of the issue is empty, but the title and patches are sufficient to understand the action taken. There's no additional context or alternative solutions provided, so the focus is solely on the upgrade.

Considering common GitHub labels, ""dependency upgrade"" is a standard label used when an issue involves updating a project's dependencies. Since this issue's sole purpose was to update Spring HATEOAS from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, assigning the ""dependency upgrade"" label makes sense.

I don't see any other labels that would better fit here. There's no indication of a bug fix, feature request, or documentation change. It's straightforward—just an upgrade to a newer version of a library.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue's intent and the changes made. So, the answer should be 1.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly identifies that the issue was about updating a project dependency from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.1. The patches confirm this by showing the version change in the build configuration.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue. The title is ""Upgrade to Spring HATEOAS 2.2.1"", and the body is empty.

First, I'll look at the title. Upgrading a specific library version usually involves updating a project's dependencies. In this case, it's about moving from an older version of Spring HATEOAS to version 2.2.1. That sounds like a dependency upgrade because Spring HATEOAS is a third-party library that the project depends on.

The body doesn't add any extra information since it's empty, so I have to rely solely on the title. The label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate here because the action described is about updating a specific library version. 

I don't see any indication that this issue is about something else like a new feature or a bug fix. It's straightforwardly about upgrading, which fits the dependency tag.

golang/go,68877,panic,go/types: 'under' panics on Alias type,"### Go version

go version go1.23.0 darwin/arm64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```This code snippet defines various environment variables used by the Go programming language, including details about the Go version, architecture, paths, and build flags.```


### What did you do?

Minimal example: <URL> 

I had some code using using APIs like `String` on `*types.Named`, as well as functions like `types.NewMethodSet`.

I upgraded that from Go 1.22.4 to Go 1.23.0

### What did you see happen?

```This code snippet shows a call stack from a Go program. It starts with a call to `(*Named).under` in `named.go`, followed by calls to `under`, `writeObject`, and `ObjectString`. The final call is to the `String` method of `TypeName` in `main.go`.```

### What did you expect to see?

Functions like `NewMethodSet` and methods like `String` should continue to work in the presence of CGo.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let's break down what each part tells me.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it says ""go/types: 'under' panics on Alias type"". The word ""panics"" here immediately stands out because a panic in Go is an unrecovered error that crashes the program. So the issue is about a situation where the code is panicking when it shouldn't.

Next, I'll read through the body of the issue. The user provides their environment details and explains that after upgrading from Go 1.22.4 to 1.23.0, they encountered a problem with using certain APIs like `String` on `*types.Named` and functions like `NewMethodSet`. They included a stack trace showing a panic in the `under` method of the `Named` type. This indicates that when their code tried to use these Go types functionalities, it resulted in a runtime panic.

The user also mentions what they expected: for those functions and methods to continue working without issues, especially in the presence of cgo, which suggests they might be using some C bindings or CGo features in their project. The expectation is that upgrading shouldn't introduce such panics.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a test case `TestIssue68877` where it defines a type alias and checks if the `String()` method on the `TypeName` returns the correct string without panicking. This suggests that the panic was occurring when trying to get the string representation of an aliased type.

Patches 2 and 4 modify the `cleanup` function in the `Named` struct's method. They change a case statement from handling only `*Named` to include `*Alias`. The comment mentions that `t.under()` might add entries, implying that without this change, when an `Alias` type was processed, it might not call `t.under()`, leading to the panic.

Patch 3 is similar but sets an environment variable and tests under different conditions, ensuring the panic doesn't occur in those scenarios either.

Putting it all together: The issue is about a panic happening when using Go's type system with alias types after an upgrade. The patches fix this by adjusting how `Named` and `Alias` types are handled during cleanup or string conversion, preventing the panic.

So the label assigned was ""panic"". Since the problem was indeed a panic occurring due to specific type operations, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The issue report is about a panic occurring in Go's type system when handling alias types after an upgrade. The patches address this by modifying how these types are managed, preventing the panic.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""panic"" correctly reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is ""go/types: 'under' panics on Alias type."" The word ""panics"" here immediately suggests that there's a runtime panic occurring, which is a type of error that causes the program to crash. So right off the bat, I'm thinking this has something to do with an unexpected panic.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user provided details about their Go environment and the output of `go env`, which shows they're using Go version 1.23.0 on Darwin (macOS) with ARM64 architecture. They also mention that they upgraded from Go 1.22.4 to 1.23.0, which likely introduced the problem.

In the ""What did you do?"" section, the user explains that their code was using APIs like `String` on `*types.Named` and functions like `types.NewMethodSet`. After upgrading, they encountered an issue.

Under ""What did you see happen?"", there's a stack trace. Let me parse this. The panic occurs in `go/types.(*Named).under`, which is a method call that seems to be failing. The trace goes through several internal Go functions related to objects and string methods, leading up to the main function where it all starts.

So, putting it together: when using certain functions from the `go/types` package after upgrading to Go 1.23.0, the program crashes with a panic in the `under` method of `Named`. The user expected that functions like `NewMethodSet` and methods like `String` would continue working, especially in the presence of cgo (CGo), but instead, they're encountering this panic.

The label assigned is ""panic."" Since the issue explicitly describes a situation where the program panics due to an error in the `under` method, it makes sense. The term ""panic"" accurately captures that the problem is causing the application to crash unexpectedly with a runtime error.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but even if there were more, the primary issue is the panic itself. So yes, the label ""panic"" is appropriate because it directly reflects the symptom described in both the title and body of the report.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it describes a runtime panic.

astral-sh/uv,6972,ci,Remove use of `macos-12` image,See: <URL>,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Remove use of `macos-12` image"". This immediately tells me that the problem is about replacing a specific macOS image version in some part of the project. The body of the issue links to a GitHub changelog post discussing upcoming deprecations and breaking changes in GitHub Actions runners, which suggests that this change is related to CI/CD infrastructure.

Next, examining the patches applied. Both Patch 1 and Patch 2 show changes where `macos-12` is being replaced with `macos-13`. Specifically, they modify the `runs-on` field in GitHub Actions workflow files. This indicates that the issue was about updating the runner images used in CI pipelines to a newer version.

The label assigned here is ""ci"". Since the issue deals directly with changing the runner images in GitHub Actions, which is part of continuous integration setup, the label seems appropriate. The changes are not about a bug fix or new feature but about the infrastructure that runs the tests and builds, hence falling under CI.

I don't see any aspects of this issue that would relate to other labels like ""bug"", ""enhancement"", or ""documentation"". It's purely about updating the CI configuration to use a newer macOS image version as per GitHub's deprecation notice.
</think>

The label ""ci"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to updating the CI runner images in GitHub Actions.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Remove use of `macos-12` image"". This suggests that the issue is about removing a specific Docker image, which is likely used in CI/CD pipelines since those often involve different OS environments for testing and deployment.

The body of the issue just links to a GitHub blog post about upcoming deprecations and breaking changes in GitHub Actions runners. I know that GitHub Actions is their CI/CD platform, so this link probably explains that certain runner images are being deprecated or changed. 

Putting it together, the issue is addressing the removal of a macOS 12 image, which is part of GitHub's CI environment. Therefore, the label ""ci"" makes sense because it's directly related to continuous integration configurations and changes in how builds or tests are run.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but even if there were others like ""bug"" or ""enhancement"", the primary focus seems to be on the CI setup. So yes, ""ci"" accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""ci"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to changes in GitHub Actions, which is a CI/CD platform.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""indexing"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me go through the details step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Cancel ADD INDEX job with DXF is slow."" The key terms here are ""ADD INDEX,"" which relates to indexing in databases. So the problem is about adding an index and then cancelling that job being slow.

Next, the body of the issue provides a bug report. It outlines steps to reproduce the problem, which involves enabling certain TiDB settings, setting a low write speed, adding an index, and then attempting to cancel the job. The user's expectation was that the cancellation would happen in a timely manner, but instead, it took a long time for the state to change from 'canceling' to 'rollback done.' This further indicates that the issue is related to how indexing operations are handled when they're canceled.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Each patch modifies functions related to reorgCtx and ddlCtx, which are components involved in the DDL (Data Definition Language) operations, particularly for adding indexes. For example, Patch 1 changes the function parameters from jobID to context, suggesting a refactor in how the reorganization context is handled during cancellations.

Patch 2 removes some testing functions related to ReorgCtx, which might be part of cleaning up or refactoring the code to improve how the state is managed when operations are canceled. Patch 3 and subsequent patches adjust function calls to pass context instead of job IDs, which likely affects how cancellations propagate through different parts of the system.

Patch 4 modifies error handling during cancellation by using a more specific error message that includes the job ID, improving clarity for debugging. Patch 5 removes test functions related to ReorgCtx, possibly because those tests are no longer necessary or were causing issues.

Patch 6 refactors the reorgCtx struct and methods, removing fields like jobState and methods like isReorgCanceled, isReorgPaused, etc., which suggests that the way the state is tracked during index operations has been changed. This could be to make state management more efficient or to prevent race conditions that might cause delays in cancellation.

Patch 7 adds a new test function, TestAddIndexDistCancelWithPartition, which specifically tests the cancellation of add index jobs with partitioning, ensuring that after the fix, cancellations happen as expected without delays. This indicates that the problem was significant enough to warrant additional testing to prevent regressions.

Putting this all together, the issue is fundamentally about a problem during the ADD INDEX operation—specifically, how quickly and effectively such operations can be canceled when needed. All the patches are aimed at improving the cancellation mechanism for index additions by adjusting context handling, error management, state tracking, and test coverage.

The label ""indexing"" captures the essence of this issue because it's about adding indexes and the associated behavior during their lifecycle, including cancellation. The problem isn't related to querying or other database operations but is specifically tied to DDL operations involving indexes.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to determine if the label ""indexing"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue report. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The title of the issue is ""Cancel ADD INDEX job with DXF is slow."" That immediately tells me that the problem has something to do with adding an index and the process being slow when canceled. The body provides more context in a structured bug report format, which includes steps to reproduce the issue, expected versus actual outcomes, and the TiDB version.

Looking at the minimal reproduce steps: enabling certain DDL flags related to fast reorg and setting a max write speed, adding an index, then canceling it. The expected outcome was timely cancellation, but instead, it took much longer for the state to change from 'canceling' to 'rollback done.'

So, the core of the issue seems to be about the behavior when attempting to cancel an ongoing ADD INDEX operation, specifically related to how quickly or efficiently that cancellation happens.

Now, considering the label ""indexing."" Indexing in databases refers to creating and managing indexes, which are data structures used to improve query performance. The problem here is about adding an index but encountering issues with the cancellation process being slow. While adding an index is indeed part of indexing, the issue isn't just about creating an index—it's about the cancellation mechanism during that process.

However, I'm trying to decide if ""indexing"" is the most accurate label. The problem does revolve around an ADD INDEX operation, which is a fundamental part of database indexing. The fact that the cancellation is slow might be a secondary aspect but still tied directly to the indexing operation.

So, while it's about the process during index creation, the core function affected is indeed the indexing mechanism. Therefore, labeling it as ""indexing"" seems appropriate because the issue arises from an action (canceling) related to adding an index.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue since the problem pertains to the ADD INDEX operation, which is part of indexing in databases.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39622,bug,Banner printing doesn't respect set charset,Forward port of issue #39621 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""Banner printing doesn't respect set charset."" That sounds like a problem where something isn't working as intended. The body says it's a forward port of another issue, which suggests it's an existing bug that needs to be fixed in a different branch or version.

Now looking at the patches made:

Patch 1 modifies some Java code related to banner printing. It adds an import for StandardCharsets and changes how the charset is handled when creating the string from the banner. Specifically, it sets a default to UTF-8 if the environment property isn't set. This indicates that previously, the charset wasn't being respected correctly, which would cause issues with how text is displayed, possibly leading to incorrect characters or encoding errors.

Patch 2 adds a test case where it checks that the banner uses UTF-8. It mocks the environment and tests whether the printer logs the correct UTF-8 characters (like emojis). This test ensures that after the fix, the charset is correctly applied, preventing any bugs related to incorrect encoding.

Patch 3 just adds a line with some UTF-8 characters, likely as a test banner file to verify the fix works correctly when the charset is set properly.

Putting it all together, the problem was that the banner wasn't using the correct charset, which would be a bug since it's not functioning as intended. The patches fix this by ensuring the correct charset is used and adding tests to confirm the behavior. Therefore, labeling this issue as a ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem being addressed.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. The title of the issue is ""Banner printing doesn't respect set charset."" Hmm, that sounds like something isn't working as expected with banner printing regarding character sets. So, it's indicating a problem or an unexpected behavior.

Looking at the body, it says, ""Forward port of issue #39621 to 3.3.x."" Okay, so this is taking an existing issue from another version and moving it to the 3.3.x branch. But the actual content of the original issue isn't provided here; we only have a reference.

Given that, the title suggests there's an issue with how banners are printed, specifically related to character encoding. That definitely sounds like a bug because it's about functionality not behaving as intended. The label ""bug"" is typically used for issues where something is broken or doesn't work correctly.

Even though the body just mentions porting the issue, the title itself indicates a problem that needs fixing. Without more context from the original issue, but based on the title alone, it's reasonable to categorize this as a bug report.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue since the title describes unexpected behavior in banner printing, indicating a functional problem.

pingcap/tidb,55156,constraint,"JDBC test related to schema, FK and `useInformationSchema=true` failed","## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Run the test of mysql j connector on TiDB, and the test `testBug95280` failed. It tests to get the FK information from JDBC. When the `useIS=false`, the test will pass, and when the `useIS=true`, the test failed (and get a redundant row).

When `useIS=true`, the mysql J connector will run the following SQL:

```This SQL query retrieves details about foreign key constraints from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. It selects and formats information such as table schemas, names, columns, constraint names, and update/delete rules from joined tables related to foreign key constraints. The results are filtered by specific table name and schema, ordered by referenced table schema and name and ordinal position.```

Therefore, this issue can be reproduced by the following SQLs:

```The SQL code creates two databases (`dbBug95280_1` and `dbBug95280_2`) with similar table structures. Each database contains two tables: `table1` for categories and `table2` for products, where `table2` has a foreign key referencing `table1`. The second part of the code retrieves the details of the foreign key constraints defined in `table2` of `dbBug95280_1`.```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The test pass

And the SQL return one row

```The log shows a foreign key constraint between `table1` and `table2` in schema `dbBug95280_1`. The primary key column in `table1` is `cat_id`, and the corresponding foreign key column in `table2` is also `cat_id`. The constraint is named `table2_ibfk_1`, and it is defined on the primary key `PRIMARY`. The constraint action is set to cascade updates and delete related records in `table2` when a referenced record in `table1` is deleted.```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The test failed

```The log shows two records of foreign key constraints:

1. Table `table1` in schema `dbBug95280_1` references `table2` in schema `dbBug95280_1` on column `cat_id`.
2. Table `table1` in schema `dbBug95280_2` references `table2` in schema `dbBug95280_2` on column `cat_id`.

Both constraints have the same properties:
- Update rule: No action (`0`)
- Delete rule: Cascade (`1`)
- Constraint name: `fk_cat`
- Primary key constraint name: `PRIMARY`
- Deferrability: Initially valid (`7`)```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```The log indicates that the TiDB version is v8.3.0-alpha-65-g94d8c123ef, with the Edition being Community. The Git Commit Hash is 94d8c123ef02f2f5543a99a937ce135ade0fe997, and it was built on August 2, 2024, at 04:26 UTC. The Go version used is go1.22.5, and race detection is disabled.```

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""constraint"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down what I know.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""JDBC test related to schema, FK and `useInformationSchema=true` failed."" This tells me that the problem is related to a JDBC test involving schemas, foreign keys (FK), and the use of Information Schema when `useInformationSchema` is set to true.

In the body, the user explains that when running the test with `useIS=true`, an extra row is returned, causing the test to fail. They provided the SQL query that's being run, which seems to fetch foreign key information from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables. The issue arises because the query returns two rows instead of one when it should only return data for a specific schema.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies how schemas are filtered in the `memtableRetriever`. It adds checks to skip certain schemas based on the extractor's filters, which might help in ensuring that only relevant schemas are considered. This could prevent extra rows from being returned when querying across multiple schemas.

Patches 2 and 3 add test cases that create tables in different databases (db1 and db2) with foreign keys and then query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to check if the filtering works correctly. These tests ensure that when querying for a specific schema, only the relevant rows are returned without including others.

The label assigned is ""constraint."" Constraints in databases refer to rules applied to table data, such as primary keys, foreign keys, etc. The issue here revolves around foreign key constraints and how they're being fetched from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. The problem was that the query was returning extra rows from different schemas, which relates to how constraints are being handled across schemas.

Considering all this, the label ""constraint"" seems appropriate because the issue is directly tied to how foreign key constraints are being queried and returned in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. The patches address filtering and ensuring that only the relevant constraints (from the correct schema) are included, which aligns with the problem described.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""constraint"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the problem.

The issue's title is about a JDBC test failing related to schema, foreign keys (FK), and when `useInformationSchema=true`. The body provides detailed steps, expected vs actual results, and TiDB version info. 

In the bug report, the user explains that when using `useIS=true`, the test fails because an extra row is returned in the query result. They provided the SQL statement that's executed and the schema setup. The problem seems to revolve around how foreign key constraints are being retrieved from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, especially when multiple databases have similar table structures.

The expected outcome was one row with specific foreign key details, but instead, two rows were returned—one for each database (dbBug95280_1 and dbBug95280_2). This suggests that the query is not properly filtering or limiting results to the relevant database, leading to extra rows being included when `useInformationSchema=true`.

Now, looking at the label ""constraint"": Constraints in databases refer to rules applied to data, such as foreign keys. Since this issue is specifically about foreign key constraints and how they're retrieved via JDBC, the label does seem appropriate.

But wait, I should consider if there's a more specific label or if ""constraint"" might be too broad. However, given that the problem is directly tied to handling of foreign key constraints in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, using ""constraint"" accurately captures the essence of the bug. There isn't a more precise label mentioned here like ""information-schema"" or ""jdbc"", so ""constraint"" fits well.

Therefore, I think the label is correct because it's directly related to how constraints (foreign keys) are handled when querying the schema information.
</think>

The issue revolves around foreign key constraints and their retrieval via JDBC, making the ""constraint"" label appropriate.

elastic/elasticsearch,107983,configuration,What is the significance of the assertion for `line.size` in `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/../cpu.stat`?,"Why do we need to assert `line.size`? Can this line of code be safely removed? On some systems, the value of `line.size` is 6, and enabling the JVM `-ea` parameter during testing leads to startup failures.
<URL>

For example: 


```This code snippet uses the `cat` command to display the contents of the file `cpu.stat` located in the slice directory `user-59756`.```

```The log indicates that there have been no periods of throttling, no bursts, and no throttling time. It also notes a total wait time of 78,240,156,074 units.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""configuration"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""What is the significance of the assertion for `line.size` in `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/../cpu.stat`?"" The user is asking about why a specific line of code (an assertion on the size of lines) is needed. They're also questioning if it can be safely removed because on some systems, this causes startup failures when JVM assertions are enabled.

In the body, they provide an example where `cpu.stat` has more entries than expected, specifically mentioning ""wait_sum"" as an extra entry. So the issue seems to revolve around handling varying numbers of lines in a system file and how the code deals with that variance.

Now, looking at the patches made: The first patch adds an ignore for additional cpu.stat fields and is categorized under type: bug. The second patch modifies the assertion from checking if `lines.size()` is exactly 3 or 5 to instead check if it's greater than or equal to 3. They also added comments explaining that when a certain feature (schedstat_enabled) is on, an additional field called wait_sum appears.

So, the problem was that the code was assuming a fixed number of lines in `cpu.stat`, but in reality, this number can vary based on system configurations or enabled features. The fix involves making the code more flexible by allowing any number of lines as long as it's at least 3 and adding documentation about why extra fields are present.

Now, considering the label ""configuration."" Configuration issues usually relate to settings, setup, or parameters that affect how software behaves. In this case, the issue arises because different systems might have varying configurations leading to different numbers of entries in `cpu.stat`. The fix involves making the code handle these variations more gracefully by ignoring extra fields and adjusting the assertion.

However, I'm a bit on the fence here. While it's related to how the system is configured (since different setups produce different line counts), the issue itself is more about the code not handling variable data correctly. It's a bug because the code made an incorrect assumption about fixed data sizes, causing failures under certain conditions.

So, ""configuration"" might be a bit of a stretch here. The problem isn't about configuration settings in the software but rather about the code's inability to handle varying system configurations. Therefore, the label might not perfectly capture the essence of the issue, which is more about a bug or an issue with flexibility in handling different system states.

Wait, no, maybe ""configuration"" is appropriate because it's about how the code reads system configuration files and handles variations based on the system's setup. The patch was to ignore additional fields, which are part of the system's configuration output.

Hmm, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, it's a bug caused by incorrect assumptions, but on the other, it's about handling varying configurations from the system. So maybe ""configuration"" is still a fitting label because the issue stems from differences in system configurations leading to different file outputs.
</think>

The label ""configuration"" is appropriate because the issue arises from variations in system configuration files that the code needed to handle more flexibly. The patches addressed this by making the code robust against such variations.

1",0,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out whether the label ""configuration"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. So, first, I'll read through the issue again.

The title asks about the significance of an assertion related to `line.size` in a specific file path. The body questions why that particular line of code is needed and if it can be removed safely. It also mentions that on some systems, `line.size` has a value of 6, and enabling JVM's `-ea` parameter causes startup failures. There's a link to the relevant Java code in Elasticsearch's repository and an example output from `cpu.stat` showing various metrics, including ""wait_sum"" which seems to be an extra entry.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""configuration"". I'm trying to recall what that label typically signifies. Usually, configuration issues relate to how something is set up or parameters used, like environment variables, config files, or command-line arguments affecting behavior.

In this case, the issue is about understanding a specific assertion in code and its impact when certain JVM settings are applied (like `-ea`). The problem arises from different values of `line.size` across systems leading to failures. It's more about code functionality, system variables, and how they affect runtime behavior rather than configuration setup.

So, ""configuration"" might not be the most accurate label here because the issue is more about code behavior and system-specific variables than about configuring Elasticsearch or its environment. Labels like ""bug"", ""question"", or ""performance"" might be more fitting.

Therefore, I don't think the label accurately reflects the content of this issue.
</think>

The issue pertains to understanding a code assertion's significance and its impact on system behavior, not configuration settings. The label ""configuration"" doesn't fit here as it's about code functionality and system variables rather than setup parameters.

microsoft/vscode,235821,bug,Toggle Reaction doesn't always show on first load of comments,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Toggle Reaction doesn't always show on first load of comments."" That suggests there's an issue where a feature isn't working as expected when the page loads. The toggle reaction not appearing consistently points to something not functioning correctly, which is a common sign of a bug.

The body of the issue is empty, so I don't have any additional context from there. But usually, titles are pretty descriptive in GitHub issues, so the title alone gives me a good clue.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There's some code that was changed to fix this issue. Let me try to understand what the patch does.

In Patch 1, they modified a section of the CommentNode class. They removed an if statement that checked if hasReactionHandler is true and created toggleReactionAction inside it. Instead, they now assign toggleReactionAction using a ternary operator based on hasReactionHandler. Then, they check if toggleReactionAction exists before pushing it into actions.

Also, in another part of the patch, they added code to unshift the toggleReactionAction into the primary actions array if it exists.

So what does this mean? It looks like they're ensuring that the toggle reaction action is properly initialized and added to the toolbar under the correct conditions. Maybe before, the action wasn't being added when it should have been on the first load because of how the condition was structured.

The original code had an if statement that only created the toggleReactionAction if hasReactionHandler was true. Then, inside that block, they pushed it into actions. But perhaps this caused the action to not be available in certain cases during the initial load, hence the bug where it doesn't show up.

By moving the creation of toggleReactionAction outside and conditionally setting it, then checking again if it exists before adding it, they ensure that the action is more reliably added when it should be. This would make the reaction picker appear consistently on first load, fixing the bug described in the issue.

So putting this all together: The title indicates a problem with functionality not working as expected (a bug), and the patches adjust the code to fix that behavior by ensuring actions are correctly added. Therefore, labeling it as a ""bug"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. The issue has a title but an empty body. Let me break it down.

The title says: ""Toggle Reaction doesn't always show on first load of comments."" That sounds like something isn't working as expected. When you toggle a reaction, it should appear immediately, right? But according to the title, sometimes it doesn't show up when the comments are loaded for the first time. That seems like unexpected behavior.

Since the body is empty, there's no additional context. But the title alone suggests that the feature isn't functioning correctly in all cases. So, this does sound like a bug because it's about the software not performing as intended. 

I don't see any indication that this is a feature request or an enhancement. It's clearly pointing out an issue with current functionality. Therefore, labeling it as a ""bug"" makes sense.

There is a `.next/server/subresource-integrity-manifest.json` file generated which contains all the correct hashes.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""You are a..."". Hmm, that doesn't seem relevant. Wait, maybe it's part of a longer conversation or context. But in this case, I think it's an incomplete prompt from an AI interaction.

Now, the issue report content is actually a diff between two code files, specifically test files related to Next.js security headers and nonce validation. The tests are checking if nonces with escape characters cause errors and if the correct headers are set when using CSP.

The patches made include modifying test cases for nonce handling, adding error messages, and adjusting expected status codes based on runtime environments. These changes suggest that there was a problem in how nonces were being validated or handled, which led to incorrect behavior—like not throwing an error when it should have.

Since these are tests and bug fixes related to security headers and nonce validation, they imply that prior to the fix, the system didn't handle certain cases correctly. For example, allowing invalid nonces without proper escaping could be a security vulnerability or a functional bug if the application crashed instead of handling it gracefully.

The label ""bug"" is assigned because these patches address issues in how the code handles specific edge cases and errors. The tests ensure that the system behaves as expected when encountering malformed nonces, which directly relates to fixing bugs in the original implementation.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" correctly applies to this GitHub issue. Let's break down what's provided.

The title of the issue is ""Subresource Integrity (SRI) not working."" That immediately suggests something isn't functioning as expected with SRI in their setup. The body goes into more detail, providing steps to reproduce and environment info, which is helpful for debugging.

Looking at the reproduction steps: they built and started the app, then checked the source code. The current behavior is that no `integrity` attribute is present on any `<script>` tags, but it's expected to be there. They also added a specific config in `next.config.mjs` to enable SRI with SHA-256. 

They mentioned that a test exists which should cover this scenario but hasn't worked for them. Additionally, the necessary manifest file is generated correctly, so the problem isn't with the setup of the config or the manifest. It seems like the issue lies in Next.js not applying the SRI attributes as intended.

Considering all this, it points to a bug in Next.js where the expected functionality (SRI) isn't working despite correct configuration and existing tests. The user expects the `integrity` attribute to be added automatically, which isn't happening. This isn't about a feature request or configuration help; it's an issue with the software not behaving as intended.

So yes, labeling this as a ""bug"" is appropriate because the expected behavior isn't matching the actual outcome, indicating a possible flaw in the code.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue report since the problem describes unexpected behavior in Next.js where SRI attributes are missing despite proper configuration.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42198,forward port,Bump jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1,Forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Alright, let's see what I've got here. So, there's a GitHub issue report with a specific title and body, along with some patches that were applied to fix it. The question is whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this issue based on those details.

First, looking at the title: ""Bump jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1."" That sounds like a version upgrade for a dependency or tool. So someone is updating the JFrog CLI setup action in their GitHub workflow from an older version (4.3.2) to a newer one (4.4.1).

Now, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x."" Hmm, okay. So this current issue is taking something that was done in another issue (#42197) and applying it to a different branch or version line, specifically 3.3.x. That makes me think they're backporting a change from one version (maybe main or a newer release branch) into the 3.3.x maintenance branch.

Looking at the patches provided, all three of them are changing the same thing: updating the JFrog CLI setup action's version from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1 in different places within the workflow files. So, each patch is just an update in a specific part of the repository where this setup step is used.

Now, the label assigned here is ""forward port."" I'm trying to recall what that means. In software development, ""forward porting"" typically refers to taking a change from an older version and applying it to a newer version. Wait, no, actually, maybe I got that backwards. Or perhaps ""backport"" is moving a fix from a newer branch to an older one, while ""forward port"" might be moving something from an older to a newer. But sometimes the terms can be a bit confusing.

Wait, in this case, the issue says it's a forward port of #42197 to 3.3.x. So if #42197 was perhaps applied to main or another branch, and now they're applying the same change to the 3.3.x branch, that would indeed be a forward port. Alternatively, maybe ""forward port"" here is intended to mean moving changes from one version line to another.

But looking at the patches themselves, all they do is update the JFrog CLI version in different parts of the workflow files. So it's a straightforward dependency upgrade. The body mentions that this is a forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x, implying that #42197 was perhaps the original bump from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1 in another branch, and now they're applying the same change to the 3.3.x branch.

So does the label ""forward port"" make sense here? Well, if the issue is about taking a change made elsewhere (in #42197) and applying it to the 3.3.x branch, then yes, that's a forward porting effort. So the label seems appropriate because they're moving or forwarding the fix or update from one place to another.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes ""forward port"" might not be the exact term used for this process. It could also be called a backport if it's moving changes to an older version branch, depending on how the branches are structured. But in this case, since 3.3.x is a specific release line and they're applying the same version bump, I think ""forward port"" fits because they're carrying forward the change into another context.

Therefore, considering all that, the label ""forward port"" does accurately reflect what's happening here. The issue is about taking an existing change (from #42197) and ensuring it applies to the 3.3.x branch by updating the same dependency version in various parts of the codebase.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this issue report as it involves applying a change from another issue (#42197) to a different branch (3.3.x). The patches update the JFrog CLI version across multiple workflow files, consistent with forward porting changes.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what each part means.

The title of the issue is ""Bump jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1"". This sounds like they're updating a dependency, specifically the setup-jfrog-cli package, from version 4.3.2 to 4.4.1. The word ""bump"" in this context usually refers to increasing the version number of a dependency.

Looking at the body, it says ""Forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x."" So they're taking an issue that was already addressed (probably in another branch) and applying those changes to the 3.3.x branch. Forward porting typically means taking changes from one branch and merging them into another, usually a newer or different version branch.

Now, the label assigned is ""forward port"". Since the body explicitly mentions it's a forward port of an issue to a specific branch, this label seems appropriate. The title also supports this by showing a version bump, which might be part of the forward porting process.

I don't see any conflicting information here. Both the title and body are about updating or moving something to another version, which aligns with what ""forward port"" means in software development terms.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40226,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring Integration 6.3.0-RC1,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Spring Integration 6.3.0-RC1"". That clearly indicates that the purpose is to update a dependency to a new version, specifically from a snapshot to an RC (Release Candidate) version.

Next, the body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context there. But the title is quite descriptive on its own, pointing directly to a version upgrade of Spring Integration.

Now, examining the patches made. The patch provided shows that in the build configuration file, specifically the bom section, the library dependency for ""Spring Integration"" was updated from 6.3.0-SNAPSHOT to 6.3.0-RC1. This is a clear indication that the project is upgrading its dependency version.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Considering all the information—the title explicitly mentions an upgrade, and the patch confirms the version change in dependencies—it seems perfectly appropriate. There's no mention of any other type of issue like a bug fix or feature request; it's solely about updating a library version.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the GitHub issue titled ""Upgrade to Spring Integration 6.3.0-RC1"". Let me break this down.

First, looking at the title: it's about upgrading to a specific version of Spring Integration, which is a framework for building integration solutions. The version mentioned is 6.3.0-RC1, which I know stands for Release Candidate 1. This suggests that they're planning to move from an older version to this new one.

Now, the body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context or details provided. But usually, when someone creates an issue with such a title, it's related to updating dependencies in their project. Upgrading a dependency like Spring Integration would typically fall under the category of ""dependency upgrade"".

I remember that on GitHub, issues are often labeled based on the main action or category they belong to. So, if this is about moving to a newer version of a library, labeling it as ""dependency upgrade"" makes sense because it's exactly what they're doing.

Wait, but could there be other labels that might also fit? Maybe something like ""version update"" or ""library upgrade"", but ""dependency upgrade"" seems more precise in the context of software development where dependencies are managed. It's a common term used in project management for such cases.

Since the title clearly states an upgrade and the label is about dependency upgrades, it aligns well without any conflicting information. Even though the body is empty, the title alone gives enough context to apply this label accurately.

So, putting it all together, yes, the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the issue report because the title explicitly mentions upgrading a specific dependency (Spring Integration) to a newer version.

These changes directly address the bug described, ensuring the correct behavior when selecting multiple items.

Since all elements point to an unintended behavior that was resolved with specific code patches, labeling it as a ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as a bug. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title of the issue: ""[Bug Report][3.5.16] VSelect always jumps back to the first record when making multiple selections."" The title clearly states it's a bug report, which suggests that the reporter is identifying an unintended behavior in the software.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. Under ""Environment,"" they've provided specific versions of Vuetify and Vue, as well as the browser and OS used. This helps in pinpointing where the problem occurs, which is common when reporting bugs to ensure others can reproduce it.

Looking at the ""Steps to reproduce,"" the user outlines selecting two items: Alabama and Guam. The expected behavior is that it should function similarly to version 3.5.15, implying that this worked correctly before but now doesn't. The actual behavior is that after choosing Guam, it jumps back to Alabama, which is unexpected.

There's a reproduction link provided, which would allow developers to see the issue firsthand, and they mention two other issues (#19593 and #19574) being related. This suggests that the problem might be part of a larger set of bugs or perhaps related to recent changes in the codebase.

Considering all these elements—the title explicitly mentions it's a bug report, detailed steps to reproduce are given, expected vs actual behavior is clearly described, environment specifics are included, and related issues are referenced—it all aligns with what you'd expect in a bug report. There's no indication that this is a feature request or an enhancement; it's purely about unexpected behavior that needs fixing.

So, the label ""bug"" fits perfectly here because it accurately categorizes the issue as a problem needing resolution rather than a new feature or other types of requests.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue report.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41836,dependency upgrade,Bump gradle/actions from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0,Forward port of issue #41835 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by looking at the title of the issue: ""Bump gradle/actions from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0."" The word ""bump"" here suggests an increase or update in version, which usually refers to upgrading a dependency.

Next, I'll check the body of the issue. It says, ""Forward port of issue #41835 to 3.4.x."" This indicates that this issue is taking something from another issue (probably a fix or change) and applying it to a different branch or version line. So, the context here is about updating or adjusting existing code to work with a newer version.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are four patches, each modifying different files in the repository. Let's go through them one by one.

Patch 1 changes the setup-gradle action from version d9c87d481d55 (which is v3.5.0) to af1da67850ed (v4.0.0). This clearly shows that a dependency on Gradle actions is being upgraded from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0.

Patch 2 does something similar in two places: updating the wrapper-validation and setup-gradle actions to use the same newer version of Gradle actions (v4.0.0). This reinforces that multiple dependencies are being updated.

Patch 3 removes a job related to validating the Gradle wrapper, specifically referencing the older version (d9c87d481d55). It seems like this patch is cleaning up or removing an outdated setup now that it's being upgraded.

Patch 4 again updates the setup-gradle action in another context, switching from v3.5.0 to v4.0.0. This further confirms that the dependency on Gradle actions is being bumped up across different parts of the repository.

Putting this all together: The issue title and body mention bumping a version and porting changes, which are consistent with upgrading dependencies. Each patch modifies references to Gradle actions, replacing the older version with a newer one. Therefore, the label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate because it accurately describes the action taken—upgrading the gradle/actions dependency from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0 across multiple places in the repository.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate as all patches consistently update the Gradle actions version, reflecting a clear dependency upgrade.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Bump gradle/actions from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0"". The word ""bump"" here suggests that a version is being increased or upgraded. Specifically, it mentions upgrading the gradle/actions package from version 3.5.0 to 4.0.0. So this clearly indicates an update of a dependency.

Next, examining the body: ""Forward port of issue #41835 to 3.4.x."" A forward port typically means taking changes or fixes from one branch and applying them to another. In this context, it's about moving the solution or fix related to issue #41835 into the 3.4.x branch. However, the primary action here is still about updating a dependency version.

The label in question is ""dependency upgrade"". Since both the title and body discuss increasing the version of gradle/actions and porting changes which are part of managing dependencies, this label seems appropriate. Dependency upgrades usually involve such version bumps and ensuring compatibility across different branches or versions of the project.

Therefore, considering all these points, the label accurately reflects the issue report.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly captures the essence of the issue, which involves updating a package version and managing related changes.

ziglang/zig,20314,enhancement,`std.Build.findProgram()` is not capable of finding non-`.exe` programs on Windows,"Since the function unconditionally appends `b.graph.host.result.exeFileExt()` to each element in `names` when testing paths, it appears to just be impossible to locate e.g. `npm.cmd` on Windows.

My first thought here is that it should just be changed to try both with and without `exeFileExt()`. That way, I can pass `.{""npm"", ""npm.cmd""}` and it should just work on Windows/Unix. I can open a PR for that if it's considered an acceptable solution.",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The title of the issue says that `std.Build.findProgram()` can't find non-`.exe` programs on Windows. So it's pointing out a limitation in how the function works, specifically when dealing with programs that don't have an `.exe` extension.

Looking at the body, the user explains that the function appends the executable file extension (like `.exe`) to each name when searching for programs. This makes sense why non-`.exe` files like `npm.cmd` aren't found on Windows. The user suggests modifying the function to try both with and without the extension, which would make it work across different operating systems.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies the `findProgram` function by introducing a new helper function `tryFindProgram`. This function seems to handle checking for multiple extensions, including those supported by Windows. It also considers environment variables like `PATHEXT`, which lists all valid executable extensions on Windows. By iterating through these, it can find programs with any of the supported extensions.

Patch 2 updates an enum from `CreateProcessSupportedExtension` to `WindowsExtension`. This change renames the enum but doesn't seem to add new functionality. However, it keeps the code in sync and makes the names more descriptive.

So, what's the nature of this issue? It's about improving how the function handles executable files on Windows by supporting multiple extensions beyond just `.exe`. The problem was a limitation, and the solution expands the capability of `findProgram` to handle a broader range of cases. This feels like an enhancement because it's adding new functionality or improving existing behavior rather than fixing a bug.

Wait, but some might argue that not finding non-`.exe` files is a bug since it doesn't work as expected on Windows where multiple extensions are valid. However, the patches don't just fix a broken feature; they extend the function to support more use cases, which aligns with an enhancement.

Also, in open-source projects, labels help categorize issues. ""Enhancement"" typically refers to new features or improvements, while ""bug"" is for fixes. Since this issue was about expanding functionality to handle more scenarios, ""enhancement"" seems appropriate.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves improving the function's capability rather than fixing a bug.

1",0,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. So, first, I need to understand what the issue is about.

The title says that `std.Build.findProgram()` can't find non-`.exe` programs on Windows. That suggests there's a problem with how the function works on Windows specifically when looking for executables that don't end with .exe, like npm.cmd.

Looking at the body, the user explains why this happens: because the function appends `b.graph.host.result.exeFileExt()` to each name in `names` when checking paths. So, it's trying to find something like ""npm.exe"" instead of ""npm.cmd"", which isn't correct for some programs on Windows.

The user then suggests a solution—changing the function to try both with and without appending the exe extension. They mention they can open a PR if that's acceptable.

Now, considering labels: ""enhancement"" typically refers to new features or improvements to existing functionality, rather than bug fixes. But wait, is this a bug? The function isn't working as intended for certain file types on Windows. It should be able to find programs regardless of their extension, but it currently can't because of how it appends the .exe.

So, if this is about fixing incorrect behavior, maybe it's a bug rather than an enhancement. Enhancements are more about adding new features or improving performance, not correcting existing issues that prevent proper functionality.

Therefore, labeling this as ""enhancement"" might be incorrect. It seems more like a bug because the function doesn't handle all cases correctly.
</think>

The label assigned is ""enhancement,"" but upon analysis, the issue describes a functional limitation where the current implementation fails to find non-`.exe` files on Windows. This indicates a bug rather than an enhancement.

astral-sh/uv,7685,bug,An invalid netrc file does not produce a warning,"I recently migrated one of our projects from poetry to uv, and one thing that made me stumble was a syntax error in my netrc file. Uv would just silently ignore the error and move on as if the netrc file did not exist, which made it a bit hard to figure out what was going on.

I think a better approach would be if the [`Netrc::new()`](<URL> call returns a _parsing error_, to log a warning about it before ignoring it, to let users know why the netrc file is being ignored.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""An invalid netrc file does not produce a warning."" This suggests that there's an unexpected behavior when the netrc file is invalid. The system isn't giving any warning about it, which could be confusing for users because they might not realize their configuration is wrong.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user migrated from Poetry to Uv and encountered a problem due to a syntax error in their netrc file. They mention that Uv silently ignores the error, making it hard to diagnose the issue. They suggest that instead of ignoring it, Uv should log a warning when there's a parsing error with the netrc file.

So, from this, it seems like the problem is that the current behavior doesn't inform the user about an invalid netrc file. Instead of silently failing, the system should provide feedback. This sounds like a bug because the expected behavior (logging a warning) isn't happening, leading to potential confusion and difficulty in troubleshooting.

Now looking at the patches made to resolve this issue. The code changes include modifications to handle errors when loading the netrc file. They introduced an enum NetrcMode with different states: Automatic, Enabled, Disabled. In the default implementation for NetrcMode, they're using LazyLock to load the netrc file. If there's an IO error (specifically if the file isn't found), it logs a debug message. For other errors, like parsing issues, it logs a warning using `warn!`.

In the middleware code, when constructing AuthMiddleware, instead of directly using Netrc::new(), they're now using this NetrcMode which encapsulates the error handling. The with_netrc method is updated to set the mode appropriately based on whether a netrc is provided.

The key part here is that the patch adds logging for errors when parsing the netrc file. So, when an invalid netrc is loaded, it logs a warning instead of staying silent. This directly addresses the issue reported by adding the necessary feedback.

Putting this together: The issue was about unexpected behavior (no warning on invalid netrc) which qualifies as a bug because it's a deviation from expected functionality. The patches fix this by adding error logging, which means the label ""bug"" is appropriate here.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue since it describes an unintended behavior where an invalid configuration isn't reported, and the patches address this by adding proper warnings.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""An invalid netrc file does not produce a warning."" That suggests that when there's an issue with the netrc file, like syntax errors, the system doesn't inform the user about it. Instead of giving a warning or error message, it just ignores the problem and continues as if nothing happened.

Now, moving to the body for more details. The user migrated from Poetry to Uv and encountered a problem due to a syntax error in their netrc file. They noticed that Uv didn't give any indication of this error; instead, it silently ignored the invalid configuration. This silence made it difficult for them to realize what was wrong because there were no warnings or logs pointing out the issue.

The user's suggestion is that when Netrc::new() is called and a parsing error occurs, a warning should be logged before ignoring the file. They believe this would help users understand why their netrc isn't being applied.

So, putting this together: The software (Uv) isn't behaving as expected because it fails to handle an invalid netrc file correctly. Instead of providing a warning or error message, it just proceeds without acknowledging the issue, which could confuse users and make troubleshooting harder. This seems like unintended behavior because one would expect some form of feedback when there's a problem with configuration files.

In software development, a ""bug"" typically refers to an unintended flaw in the code that causes the program to behave differently than expected. In this case, the lack of warning when the netrc file is invalid could be considered a bug because it leads to silent failures which are not user-friendly and can cause issues for users trying to set up their environment correctly.

Alternatively, one might argue whether this is more of an enhancement or feature request since the user is suggesting adding a warning. However, the core issue is that the system isn't handling errors properly, which fits the definition of a bug because it's about incorrect behavior rather than a missing feature.

Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" seems appropriate because it points to a flaw in how the current implementation handles invalid netrc files.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue described. The problem lies in unintended software behavior where an invalid configuration isn't reported, leading to silent failures and user confusion, which fits the definition of a bug.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39138,enhancement,Retry JDK downloads,"A couple of builds failed recently as the JDK download tasks failed due to the connection being reset. To make the build a little more robust, we should automatically retry the downloads.",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Retry JDK downloads"". This suggests that the problem is about handling failed JDK downloads by retrying them. So, it seems like a feature addition or improvement rather than fixing a bug.

The body of the issue explains that builds failed because the connection was reset during JDK downloads. The user proposes making the build more robust by automatically retrying the downloads. This sounds like adding a new functionality to handle retries, which would make the system more reliable.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Both Patch 1 and Patch 2 add a line `retries 3` in the task configuration. This means they're implementing a retry mechanism with three attempts. Adding this parameter is enhancing the existing download task by making it retry failed downloads, which directly addresses the issue described.

So, the label ""enhancement"" fits because it's improving the system's behavior rather than fixing a bug. If it were a bug fix, the label might be something like ""bug"" or ""fix"". Since this is adding a new feature to make the download process more robust, ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the changes made.
</think>

The issue report and patches add retry functionality to improve reliability, which is an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. The issue's title is ""Retry JDK downloads,"" and the body explains that some builds failed because the JDK download tasks failed due to connection resets. They suggest making the build more robust by automatically retrying the downloads.

First, I need to understand what an enhancement label typically means on GitHub. From what I know, enhancements are usually for new features or improvements to existing functionality. They're about adding something that makes the project better but isn't necessarily fixing a bug.

Looking at this issue, it's about adding a retry mechanism to handle failed JDK downloads. The problem described is builds failing because of connection issues, and the solution proposed is to make the system automatically retry these downloads. This sounds like an improvement to the build process's reliability rather than fixing a bug in existing code.

So, is this an enhancement? Well, it's not exactly a new feature but more about making the current feature (JDK download) more robust. Enhancements can also include improvements that make the system more resilient or user-friendly. Since the issue isn't about fixing a bug but improving functionality to handle exceptions better, labeling it as an enhancement makes sense.

Alternatively, if this were about fixing a specific error causing downloads to fail, it might be a bug. But since it's about adding retries to handle transient issues, which is more of a functional improvement, enhancement fits better.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the issue report because it proposes an improvement to handle transient connection issues by adding automatic retries, enhancing the build process's robustness.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33091,regression,Trace and Span IDs are no longer propagated RequestBodyAdvice beans,"Originally raised in <URL> (with a reproducer project).

It looks to me like the reason for lack of Trance and Span IDs is the fix for #32730.

If you run the sample with Spring Boot 3.3.0 with a breakpoint in `OncePerRequestFilter.doFilter()` you'll see that the call to`skipDispatch()` return `false`. With Spring Boot 3.3.1 `skipDispatch()` returns `true` because [the `shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch()` method has been removed](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what a regression is in software terms. A regression usually refers to a bug that was introduced in a newer version of the software which wasn't present in previous versions. So, if something used to work and then stopped working after an update, that's a regression.

Looking at the title of the issue: ""Trace and Span IDs are no longer propagated RequestBodyAdvice beans."" This suggests that trace and span IDs were being propagated before but aren't anymore. That sounds like functionality that has regressed.

Now, the body of the issue provides more context. It mentions that the problem was originally raised in another Spring Boot issue (#41220) with a reproducer project. The user believes the cause is related to a fix for issue #32730. They explain that after updating from Spring Boot 3.3.0 to 3.3.1, the method `skipDispatch()` returns true because another method was removed in a commit. This led to the trace and span IDs not being propagated as before.

The patches provided show changes made to fix this issue. In Patch 1, they added an override for `shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch()` to return false instead of whatever it did before. They also adjusted conditions where the observation is stopped based on dispatcher type. In Patch 2, there are test cases added or modified, such as changing a test from expecting not to process async dispatches to now allowing them and adding new tests to check if observations are correctly handled in async contexts.

Putting this together: The original problem was introduced when a previous fix (for #32730) caused the trace IDs to stop propagating. This indicates that after an update, functionality broke which wasn't broken before—so it fits the definition of a regression. The patches aim to correct this by reverting or adjusting how async dispatches are handled.

Therefore, assigning the label ""regression"" seems accurate because the issue is due to a change in behavior introduced in a newer version that breaks existing functionality.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression means in software terms. From what I remember, a regression is when a bug or issue appears again after it was previously fixed. It can also refer to something breaking because of another change or fix.

Looking at the title: ""Trace and Span IDs are no longer propagated RequestBodyAdvice beans."" So the problem here is that trace and span IDs aren't being passed on as they should be, specifically in these RequestBodyAdvice beans. This seems like a functionality issue where something isn't working as expected.

Now, diving into the body of the issue. The user mentions that this was originally raised in another Spring Boot issue, #41220, and there's a reproducer project linked. They suspect the cause is related to the fix for issue #32730. So they're pointing out that when they run their sample on Spring Boot 3.3.0, a certain method returns false, but after updating to 3.3.1, it starts returning true because some code was removed.

They provided a link to a specific commit in the Spring Framework repository where the method shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch() was removed. This removal seems to be the culprit behind the change in behavior. 

So putting this together: before (in 3.3.0), without that fix, the filter wasn't skipping, so trace and span IDs were being propagated correctly. After applying the fix for #32730 by removing a method in 3.3.1, now it skips, leading to the trace and span IDs not propagating anymore.

This indicates that fixing one issue introduced another problem. Therefore, this is a regression because it's an unintended consequence of a previous change. The functionality that was working before stopped working after an update.

Therefore, labeling this as ""regression"" makes sense because it's a case where something broke after a change that was intended to fix another issue.

microsoft/vscode,213630,documentation,ChatResultFeedbackKind Unhelpful and Helpful doc comments are mixed up,"Testing #213514

Unhelpful mentions helpful in doc comment and vice versa.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""ChatResultFeedbackKind Unhelpful and Helpful doc comments are mixed up."" The word ""doc comments"" immediately stands out, which refers to documentation comments in code. So the issue is about a problem with the documentation.

The body of the issue says, ""Testing #213514. Unhelpful mentions helpful in doc comment and vice versa."" This confirms that the documentation comments for these enums have their descriptions swapped. That's definitely a documentation issue because it's about the accuracy of the comments explaining the code.

Now looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 shows changes to an enum called ChatResultFeedbackKind. The comments for Unhelpful and Helpful were swapped, which is exactly what the body described. So the fix was correcting the doc comments.

There's another patch that adds some lines about cancelling a stream, but that seems unrelated to the main issue. The primary change is in the documentation of the enum values.

Since both the title, body, and the relevant patches all pertain to incorrect or swapped documentation comments, the label ""documentation"" fits perfectly. It accurately describes the nature of the problem and the fix applied.
</think>

The label ""documentation"" is appropriate because the issue concerns incorrect doc comments which were fixed by swapping them.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""documentation"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's look at the details provided.

The issue has a title: ""ChatResultFeedbackKind Unhelpful and Helpful doc comments are mixed up."" That suggests something's wrong with the documentation comments related to these two feedback kinds. The body adds more info, mentioning that in testing #213514, the unhelpful mentions helpful in the doc comment and vice versa. So it seems like the documentation has mixed up the terms for Unhelpful and Helpful.

The label assigned is ""documentation."" Since the issue is about incorrect or swapped comments in the documentation, this label makes sense because it directly relates to documentation errors. There's no mention of bugs in code functionality, just issues with the doc comments. So yes, the label accurately reflects the problem described.

vim/vim,15275,missing,Missing separator ,<URL>,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""missing"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by looking at the issue's title and body.

The title is ""Missing separator,"" which suggests that there was an issue where a separator was missing somewhere in the code. The body of the issue is a link to a specific line in the Vim repository's Makefile, pointing to line 320 of src/po/Makefile. That indicates that the problem is related to that particular line.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

In Patch 1, there are two changes:
- Line 314: Changed from `POT_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH != pwd` to `POT_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH = $(PWD)`
- Line 327: Changed from `MO_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH != pwd` to `MO_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH = $(PWD)`

It seems like the issue was with how the POT and MO paths were being set. The original code used `!= pwd`, which is a shell command substitution, but perhaps that wasn't working correctly in this context because it's inside a Makefile. Changing it to `$(PWD)` might be more appropriate for Make syntax, as variables are typically accessed with $(VAR). This would fix the missing separator issue if the paths weren't being set properly before.

Patch 2 adds an included patch number 595. It looks like this is adding a new patch to a list of patches in some code file. The inclusion of patch 595 could be related to the missing separator, perhaps indicating that this specific patch addresses that particular problem.

Putting it together: The issue was about a missing separator in line 320 of Makefile. The patches changed how variables are assigned by replacing shell commands with Make variables and added a new patch entry. This suggests that the original problem was indeed due to a missing or incorrect path separator, which caused issues in the build process. Therefore, applying these patches fixed the issue.

The label ""missing"" was assigned. Since the problem involved something being missing (the correct path separator or variable assignment), this label does seem appropriate because it captures the essence of the issue—something was missing or incorrect, leading to a problem that needed fixing.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""missing"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Missing separator"". The word ""missing"" is directly mentioned here, which immediately suggests that something is absent or not present as expected. This could refer to a missing feature, function, or element in the codebase.

Next, examining the body of the issue: it's a link to a specific line in a Makefile within the Vim repository. The URL points to line 320 where there might be an issue related to a separator. Without accessing the link, I can infer that the problem is about a missing separator in that part of the code.

The label ""missing"" seems relevant because both the title and body imply something is absent. The title explicitly states it's about a missing separator, so assigning the label makes sense as it categorizes the issue accurately under a missing element category.

In addition, we should allow to open in the background from the picker, so that multiple entries can be looked at.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The issue's title is about improving the local history feature in an editor. It mentions two main points: sorting the picker by recent editor history and allowing background opening. The body elaborates that currently, the list is huge and not sorted by relevance, making it less useful. The user suggests prioritizing recent editors and enabling background access for efficiency.

Looking at the patches provided, they show changes in code related to how resources are fetched and displayed. They import additional services like IHistoryService and modify the resource picker to sort based on recency. There's also a change allowing the entry picker to accept input in the background by setting canAcceptInBackground to true.

The label assigned is ""workspace."" In GitHub, labels help categorize issues. The term ""workspace"" generally refers to features related to the editor environment, including local history, file management, and user interface elements like pickers. Since this issue deals with enhancing how local history entries are displayed and interacted with within the editor, it fits under workspace-related improvements.

I don't see any mentions of areas outside the workspace, such as API changes, bugs in specific extensions, or performance issues unrelated to UI/UX. All modifications are within the editor's functionality, specifically improving user interaction with local history.

Therefore, the label ""workspace"" accurately captures the essence of this issue report.
</think>

The label ""workspace"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to enhancing the local history feature within the editor environment, which falls under workspace improvements.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out whether the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the title and body of the issue carefully. The title is ""Local history: sort picker by editor history and allow to open in background."" So, it seems like the user is talking about a feature related to local history in their IDE or editor. They mention two main points: sorting the picker based on recent editor history and allowing entries to be opened in the background.

Looking at the body, they explain that currently, when using ""Local History: Find Entry to Restore,"" it opens a large list of all files across projects. The user suggests improving this by making the list sort based on how recently each file was edited, so more recent ones appear at the top. Additionally, they want the ability to open these entries in the background, allowing multiple entries to be viewed without disrupting the current workflow.

Now, considering the label assigned is ""workspace."" I know that in GitHub issues, labels help categorize what the issue relates to. The term ""workspace"" generally refers to the environment where development happens, which could include features related to how files are managed or accessed within the editor.

The user's suggestions about sorting by editor history and background opening both relate to enhancing the usability of the local history feature within their workspace. These changes would make navigating and restoring files more efficient, directly affecting how a developer interacts with their coding environment. Therefore, the ""workspace"" label seems appropriate because it pertains to the tools and features available in the development workspace.

I don't see any mention of other categories like performance, bug fixes, or specific components outside the workspace context. So yes, ""workspace"" accurately captures the essence of this issue.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)



master, v8.4.0",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""infoschema"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""unexpected 'infoschema v1/v2 switch' log"". The word ""infoschema"" is right there in the title, which immediately suggests that the problem is related to infoschema. So the label seems relevant just from the title alone.

Next, reading through the body of the issue, it's a bug report about unexpected logging when switching between v1 and v2 of infoschema. The user describes starting a new TiDB instance on master version 8.4.0 and expecting to see logs using infoschema v2 but instead finding messages about a switch between versions. This further indicates that the issue is specifically about infoschema and its versioning.

Now, looking at the patches provided. The changes are in functions related to loading info schemas and deciding whether to use v1 or v2. There's a function called shouldUseV2 which has parameters related to old info schema and snapshot loads. The patch modifies how this function behaves when the old info schema is nil or not, affecting whether it returns enableV2 and sets isV1V2Switch correctly.

These patches directly address the handling of infoschema versions within the codebase, aiming to prevent unexpected switching between v1 and v2 which was causing the log messages mentioned in the issue. So the changes are clearly targeted at the infoschema component.

Considering all these points—the title mentions ""infoschema"", the body describes issues with version switching logs, and the patches modify functions handling info schema versions—it's clear that the label ""infoschema"" is accurate and directly related to the problem being reported and resolved.

Alright, so I need to determine whether the label ""infoschema"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue described by its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""unexpected 'infoschema v1/v2 switch' log"". The term ""infoschema"" is present here, which immediately suggests that the issue relates to something called infoschema. So that's a point in favor of the label being accurate.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. It's structured as a bug report with several sections. 

In section 1, the minimal reproduce step mentions starting a new TiDB on the master version. That sets up the context but doesn't directly mention infoschema beyond what's in the title.

Section 2 asks what was expected: ""check the log, it should use infoschema v2"". Here again, ""infoschema"" is explicitly mentioned, specifically expecting to see version 2 in use. This reinforces that the issue revolves around infoschema functionality.

In section 3, describing what was actually seen: ""found log like 'infoschema v1/v2 switch'"". The presence of both v1 and v2 in the logs indicates an unexpected behavior related to infoschema versions. So this is definitely about an issue with infoschema.

Section 4 provides the TiDB version as master, v8.4.0, which doesn't directly relate to the label but adds context about the environment where the bug occurred.

Putting it all together, the title and body both consistently refer to ""infoschema"" in their descriptions of the problem. The issue is about unexpected logging related to switching between versions of infoschema. Therefore, the label ""infoschema"" is appropriate because it directly pertains to the subject matter described.

I don't see any information in the title or body that would suggest a different or additional label being more accurate. All references point specifically to issues within the infoschema component.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""DISABLED test_cow_input_sparse_sampled_addmm_cuda_float32 (__main__.TestCompositeComplianceCUDA)"". It mentions that a specific test was disabled because it's failing in CI. So this is about a test failure issue.

In the body, they provide details about the platform (linux), links to CI logs, and mention that the test has been flaky with multiple failures. They also give debugging instructions and reference the test file path as `test_ops.py`. The problem seems to be related to a failing test in their test suite, specifically a CUDA-related test.

Now, looking at the patches provided. It's a code change where they added a condition before running some checks. Specifically, they check if all results are strided tensors with `all_results_strided = all(is_strided_tensor(result) for result in results)`. If this condition is true, then they proceed with creating output gradients and performing the backward pass with autograd.

So what's the issue here? The test was failing because it wasn't handling cases where some results might not be strided tensors. By adding this check, they're ensuring that the backward operations are only performed when all results are compatible, which would fix the flaky test.

Now, considering the labels in GitHub issues. Common labels include ""bug"", ""test failure"", ""runtime"", etc. The label assigned here is ""runtime"". I'm trying to think what ""runtime"" typically refers to. Usually, runtime issues are about problems that occur during execution, like crashes, performance issues, or unexpected behavior when running the code.

In this case, the problem was a failing test in CI, which suggests it's a test failure issue rather than a runtime error in production code. The patches fix the condition under which certain operations are performed, preventing the test from incorrectly handling non-strided tensors and thus causing failures.

So does ""runtime"" accurately capture that? Maybe not entirely. It feels more like a test reliability or bug where the test wasn't correctly handling certain tensor types. So perhaps labels like ""test failure"", ""bug"", or ""CI"" would be more appropriate than ""runtime"".

But sometimes, issues related to how code behaves during execution (like autograd operations) could fall under runtime. However, since this is about a test failing and not the actual code misbehaving at runtime for users, I'm leaning towards it being a test issue rather than a runtime one.

Therefore, the label ""runtime"" might not be the most accurate here.
</think>

The label assigned does not accurately reflect the issue because the problem pertains to a failing test in CI, which is more about test reliability or a bug in testing rather than a general runtime issue. 

0",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the title and body of the issue carefully.

The title says: ""DISABLED test_cow_input_sparse_sampled_addmm_cuda_float32 (__main__.TestCompositeComplianceCUDA)"". That immediately tells me that a specific test has been disabled because it's failing in CI, which is continuous integration. So the problem here is related to a failing test case.

Looking at the body, it mentions that the test was disabled due to failures in CI. It provides links to flaky test examples and workflow logs for further debugging. The issue also notes that over three hours, there were 2 workflows with 6 failures and 2 successes, indicating the test is flaky—sometimes passing, sometimes failing.

The body goes on to give debugging instructions, advising not to assume everything is okay just because CI is green, which implies that the issue might be intermittent or hard to reproduce consistently. It guides how to find relevant logs by expanding the test step in the workflow and grepping for the specific test name. The test file path is provided as `test_ops.py`, and several people are CC'd.

Now, considering the label assigned is ""runtime."" I know that labels in GitHub help categorize issues into different types like bug, feature request, documentation, etc. So what does ""runtime"" typically refer to? It usually relates to issues that occur during the execution of the code, such as crashes, performance problems, or unexpected behavior while the program is running.

In this case, the issue is about a test being disabled because it's failing in CI. The test failure suggests there might be an underlying bug causing inconsistent results—sometimes passing and sometimes failing. Since tests are part of the runtime environment and their failure affects the code's functionality during execution, labeling this as ""runtime"" makes sense.

Alternatively, some might think about other labels like ""bug"" or ""test-failure."" However, since the problem is specifically related to a test failing in CI, which pertains to the behavior of the code when it runs, ""runtime"" seems appropriate. It's more about how the code behaves during execution rather than being a bug in the code itself or an issue with testing frameworks.

So, considering all this, I think the label ""runtime"" does accurately reflect the nature of the issue reported here.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39226,forward port,JarEntry.getComment() returns incorrect result from NestedJarFile instances,Forward port of issue #39166 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. 

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""JarEntry.getComment() returns incorrect result from NestedJarFile instances."" So, the problem is about a method returning wrong results when dealing with NestedJarFile instances. That suggests it's a bug fix rather than a new feature.

The body says, ""Forward port of issue #39166 to 3.3.x."" This immediately tells me that this issue is taking something from another version (probably a fix or change) and applying it to the 3.3.x branch. So the primary purpose here is to bring an existing solution into a different codebase or version.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies some lines in a file related to how comments are read from zip entries. It changes the condition for checking the comment length and adjusts where it reads the comment from. This seems like a bug fix to correctly handle comments when using NestedJarFile.

Patch 2 adds a test case that creates a JAR file, writes some entries with comments, and then checks if both the JDK's JarFile and the project's NestedJarFile return the same comments. The test ensures that after the fix, the behavior aligns with what's expected, confirming it's a bug fix.

Putting this together: the issue is about fixing a bug where getComment() doesn't work right in NestedJarFile instances. The body mentions it's a forward port, meaning they took a fix from another branch (like main) and applied it to 3.3.x. The patches are indeed fixing that issue by adjusting how comments are read and adding a test to verify the fix.

So, the label ""forward port"" is correct because the issue involves taking an existing fix and applying it to another version branch. It's not introducing a new feature or just a regular bug fix without being a port.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it involves forwarding a fix from one branch to another.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""forward port"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the title and body provided.

The title says: ""JarEntry.getComment() returns incorrect result from NestedJarFile instances."" That sounds like a bug report because it mentions a method returning an incorrect result, which is a problem that needs fixing.

Now, looking at the body: ""Forward port of issue #39166 to 3.3.x."" Hmm, I know that in software development, a ""forward port"" usually refers to taking a fix from one branch (often the main or development branch) and applying it to another branch, typically a maintenance or stable branch. So this suggests they're moving a fix from a previous issue into version 3.3.x.

The label assigned is ""forward port."" Since the body explicitly mentions forwarding an existing issue to another release, that seems accurate. The title describes the bug itself, but the action being taken here is about porting the fix forward.

So yes, the label correctly reflects that this issue is about moving a previously fixed issue into a newer version line.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves moving a fix to another branch.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""testing"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""DISABLED test_second_order_accurate (__main__.TestGradient)"". That immediately tells me that a specific test named test_second_order_accurate in the TestGradient class has been disabled. The word ""DISABLED"" suggests that this test was turned off, probably because it was failing.

Looking at the body of the issue, it mentions that the test was disabled because it's failing on the main branch, with a link provided to recent failures. This reinforces that the problem is related to a failing test case. The body also CCs several people, which is common in GitHub issues to notify collaborators or experts who might be able to help.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. There's only one patch provided here. It shows two changes: an import statement for torch was added, and a decorator was added to the test_second_order_accurate method. The decorator is @torch._dynamo.config.patch(use_numpy_random_stream=True). This suggests that the test was failing because of some inconsistency in random number generation, possibly due to non-deterministic behavior affecting test reliability.

So, putting it all together: The issue was about a disabled test that was failing, and the fix involved modifying the test by adding a configuration to control random streams. This makes sense because tests, especially those involving numerical computations or machine learning, often require deterministic behavior to ensure consistent results across runs. Without such controls, flaky tests can occur where failures are intermittent.

The label assigned is ""testing"". Considering that this issue revolves around a test being disabled and then fixed by adjusting its configuration, it's clear that the problem is related to testing infrastructure or test reliability. The changes made are within the test code itself, aimed at ensuring the test passes consistently.

Therefore, the label ""testing"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue because it pertains to test cases, their execution, and their reliability. It's not about a bug in the main codebase but specifically about the tests themselves.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""testing"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""DISABLED test_second_order_accurate (__main__.TestGradient)"". The word ""test"" is right there, which immediately makes me think this has something to do with testing. Also, the test being disabled suggests that it's related to issues in testing, maybe a failing test.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. It mentions that the test was disabled because it's failing on the main branch, with a link provided for recent failures. This indicates that the problem is specifically about a test failure. They've also CC'd several people, which is common in collaborative projects when assigning or notifying team members about an issue.

The body goes into some detail about why the test was disabled and provides links to more information on the failures. That's all within the realm of testing—specifically, test maintenance or troubleshooting failed tests.

So putting it all together: the title mentions a disabled test, and the body explains that it's failing and has been disabled because of that. The label ""testing"" seems appropriate here because the issue is about handling a problematic test case in their test suite. It doesn't seem to be about a bug in the code itself or a feature request; it's more about the testing infrastructure.

I don't see any elements that would suggest this is unrelated to testing. There's no mention of new features, bugs outside the tests, or documentation issues. Therefore, the label ""testing"" accurately reflects the content of the issue report.

We are effectively treating x/telemetry as frozen for the moment, and want to make sure any bugfixes are included in the Go release.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is showing.

First, looking at the issue report's title: it says something about an HTTP error when trying to access a specific URL. The user provided a stack trace from their program, which indicates that there's an issue with the 'net/http' package in Go, specifically mentioning a 404 Not Found error for ""http://10.240.0.1/healthz"". 

Now, moving on to the patches made to the repository. I see multiple changes across different files and modules. Let me go through some of them.

In patch 22, there's an update to a Go module: golang.org/x/mod was bumped from v0.18.0 to v0.19.0. Similarly, in patch 26 and 27, golang.org/x/sys is upgraded from v0.21.0 to v0.22.0. These are clear indications that dependencies are being updated.

Other patches show changes in code files, such as modifications to the `Report` struct where the 'Week' field's description was updated. There's also a change in how reports are handled during uploads, specifically around checking if a report already exists before proceeding. But these seem more like functional changes rather than dependency upgrades.

The key point here is that several patches involve updating Go modules to newer versions. This directly relates to the ""dependency upgrade"" label because it involves changing the versions of external libraries (dependencies) used by the project.

So, putting it all together: the issue report was resolved by upgrading some dependencies to their newer versions. The stack trace points to an error that might have been fixed in a later version of one of these modules. Therefore, applying these dependency upgrades would address the HTTP error encountered.

Thus, labeling this issue as ""dependency upgrade"" is appropriate because it accurately reflects the changes made to resolve the problem.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly captures the essence of the issue resolution since the patches involved updating Go modules to newer versions. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue's title is ""cmd/go: revendor x/telemetry prior to go1.23.0"". The word ""revendor"" suggests that they're updating or refreshing a dependency, which in this case is the x/telemetry package. Vendoring usually refers to managing dependencies within a project by including them directly.

Looking at the body of the issue: it's a reminder to re-vendor x/telemetry with bug-fixes before go1.23rc1. They mention treating x/telemetry as frozen, implying that no new changes are being added from it. The main goal is to include any existing bug fixes into the Go release.

So the key points here are updating a dependency (x/telemetry) by vendoring it, specifically to incorporate bug-fixes before a certain version of Go (1.23rc1). This action seems aimed at ensuring that the Go project includes the latest stable or fixed version of x/telemetry.

Now, considering the label ""dependency upgrade"". An upgrade typically means moving to a newer version of a dependency, which can include bug fixes. In this case, re-vendoring is about including those fixes before a release, so it does fit under upgrading the dependency.

However, I should think if there's a more precise term. Vendoring could also be part of a broader category like ""dependency management"" or ""vendor update"". But among the given options, ""dependency upgrade"" seems to capture the essence: updating the project's dependencies to a newer state that includes fixes.

Wait, is ""upgrade"" always about moving to a higher version? In this case, it's more about ensuring bug-fixes are included before a specific release. So maybe it's not exactly an upgrade in terms of versioning but more about incorporating necessary changes. But the term ""upgrade"" can also refer to improving the dependency by adding fixes.

Alternatively, if there were labels like ""vendor update"" or ""bug fix"", those might be closer. But given only ""dependency upgrade"" as the label, it still seems appropriate because they are updating their vendored dependencies with fixes before a release.

So yes, I think ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects this issue.

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

Starting with the title: ""Starting on 11/21 nightlies with inference_mode() gives black images using diffusers SD"". This clearly indicates an unexpected behavior where images are black when using certain configurations. That's a sign of a bug.

Looking at the body, the user describes that using specific versions of PyTorch (2.3.0.dev20231121+cu121 and later) with `inference_mode()` and `torch.compile()` results in black images or NOISE images. They also mention a runtime warning about invalid values when casting, which suggests something is wrong during the image processing.

The user provided a minimal reproducible example where enabling `torch.inference_mode()` causes issues, but disabling it works. This shows that the problem is tied to specific code paths in PyTorch when inference mode and compilation are used together.

The patches modify how scales are calculated in an upsample function. They change variable names from 'scales' to 'inv_scales' and adjust where scaling factors are applied, adding a check for None. This indicates that the root cause was incorrect handling of scaling values, leading to invalid computations that produced black images. The patch corrects this by properly inverting scales only when provided.

Since the issue is about unexpected behavior due to a code flaw, which was fixed with specific patches, labeling it as ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the report as it describes an unintended behavior resolved by code changes.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Starting on 11/21 nightlies with inference_mode() gives black images using diffusers SD"". This suggests that there's an issue where using `inference_mode()` with certain nightly builds results in black images. That sounds like a problem or unexpected behavior, which typically falls under a bug.

Now, examining the body. The user describes that starting from version 2.3.0.dev20231121+cu121 and later, using `with inference_mode()` along with `torch.compile()` produces black images. They also mention a runtime warning related to invalid values in an image processing step. This indicates something is wrong during the inference process, leading to incorrect outputs (black images or noise). 

Additionally, they provided a code snippet that reproduces the issue and noted that without using `inference_mode()`, the code works as expected. They also referenced specific commits related to AOTAutograd and interactions with `torch.compile` under `inference_mode`, which might be causing internal test failures. This points towards a regression or an unintended side effect introduced by recent changes.

The error logs mention a runtime warning about invalid values in casting, which further supports that there's a bug in how the images are being processed when using the specified configurations.

Considering all this information, the issue is clearly describing unexpected behavior that shouldn't happen under normal circumstances. The use of `bug` as a label seems appropriate because it highlights an error or malfunction in the code after certain changes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue report as it describes unexpected behavior causing black images when using specific configurations, indicating a malfunction.

JuliaLang/julia,53021,regression,automatically generated counterexamples for `<:` transitivity,"Here's a Git repository containing a Julia package that generates counterexamples to the transitivity property that `<:` is supposed to satisfy:

<URL>

So far I tested it on v1.10 and v1.11-DEV: the results between these two versions are the same and may be found under `results/`. I'll give just two of the counterexamples here, see the rest on my repo:

This is the first counterexample in the results:

```The code snippet defines a counterexample triplet involving type tuples in Julia. Specifically:

1. `(Tuple{X, X} where X<:Union{})`: A tuple of two elements of the same type `X`, where `X` is a subtype of `Union{}`.
2. `(Tuple{C, C})`: A tuple of two elements of the same type `C`.
3. `(Tuple{X, X, Vararg{Any}} where C<:X<:C)`: A tuple of at least two elements of the same type `X`, with additional elements of any type, where `C` is a subtype of `X`, and `X` is a subtype of `C`.```

In the REPL:

```The code defines three tuple types with type parameters and constraints:

- `T1` is a tuple of two elements of the same type `X`, where `X` is a subtype of `Union{}`.
- `T2` is a tuple of two `C` elements.
- `T3` is a tuple of two elements of the same type `X`, followed by any number of elements of any type, where `C` is a subtype of `X`, which itself is a subtype of `C`.

The code then checks the subtype relationships:
- `T1` is a subtype of `T2`, which is a subtype of `T3`.
- `T1` is not a subtype of `T3`.```

This is the last counterexample in the results:

```The code snippet describes a counterexample triplet involving tuple types:

1. `Tuple{A, X, Vararg{X}} where X<:C`
2. `Tuple{Any, Vararg{C}}`
3. `Tuple{Any, Vararg{X}} where X>:C`

This represents a specific case used for testing or demonstrating some property or behavior in a type system or programming language.```

In the REPL:

```The code defines three tuple types with specific constraints and checks their subtype relationships. It creates:
- `T1` as a tuple of an `A`, an `X`, and variadic `X` where `X` is a subtype of `C`.
- `T2` as a tuple of `Any` and variadic `C`.
- `T3` as a tuple of `Any` and variadic `X` where `X` is a supertype of `C`.

It then verifies that `T1` is a subtype of `T2`, which is itself a subtype of `T3`, but `T1` is not a subtype of `T3`.```",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects this issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: It mentions something about Union normalization and typevar elimination causing incorrect subtyping results. From what I understand, a regression in software terms usually refers to a bug that was introduced after some changes, leading to a feature that previously worked no longer functioning correctly. So if this issue is about Union types not normalizing as expected and causing incorrect subtyping, it might be a regression.

Next, looking at the patches provided. There are several code changes in different files, especially related to type normalization and subtyping logic. For instance, Patch 1 modifies functions dealing with subtype checks and union normalization. This suggests that the issue was due to an error introduced in previous code, which now needs fixing. That aligns with a regression because it's about reverting or correcting something that went wrong after some updates.

Patch 3 includes changes in functions like `subtype_var` and `obvious_subtype`, adding checks for leaf bounds of type variables. This seems to address cases where the subtyping logic was incorrectly allowing certain type relations, which could be a regression if these were previously handled correctly but started failing after some code changes.

Patch 4 adds new test cases related to Union normalization issues. These tests are meant to ensure that specific Union and typevar scenarios work as intended, which implies that prior behavior wasn't correct—again pointing towards a regression.

Patch 5 modifies existing test cases, adding more checks for issues like diagonal rule applications and Union subtyping. This further supports the idea that there were failing or incorrect behaviors that needed fixing, consistent with a regression scenario.

The label ""regression"" is typically used when a bug causes functionality to break that was working before. Given the patches are about correcting Union normalization and typevar elimination which led to incorrect subtyping, it seems like these issues arose after some changes in the codebase. Therefore, this problem fits the definition of a regression because it's addressing unintended side effects from previous updates.

So, considering all these factors—the nature of the issue being related to bugs introduced by prior changes, and the patches aimed at correcting them—I think the label ""regression"" is appropriate.
</think>

1",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me read through everything carefully.

The title of the issue is about automatically generated counterexamples for `<:` transitivity. From what I know, `<:` in Julia refers to subtype relationships. So the issue seems to be pointing out that the transitivity isn't holding as expected because there are counterexamples where if T1 <: T2 and T2 <: T3, then T1 should also be a subtype of T3, but it's not happening here.

Looking at the body, the user provided examples using Julia code. They created some tuple types with specific type parameters and showed that even though T1 is a subtype of T2 and T2 is a subtype of T3, T1 isn't a subtype of T3 directly. That clearly violates transitivity, which is a fundamental property for subtyping relations.

They also mentioned testing this on versions 1.10 and 1.11-DEV, with the same results each time. This suggests that the problem isn't new; it's consistent across these versions. 

Now, what's a regression? A regression is when a bug or issue reappears after it was previously fixed, or when something that used to work stops working, usually due to a change in the codebase. But here, the user didn't mention if this was previously working and then broke again. They just found these counterexamples in the current versions.

So the label ""regression"" might not be accurate because it's about a new issue or an ongoing problem, not something that regressed from a previous state. The examples provided are showing a current bug in the type system regarding transitivity. Therefore, ""bug"" would be more appropriate than ""regression.""
</think>

The issue describes a violation of the `<:` subtype transitivity without indicating it's a regression. Thus, the label doesn't fit.

pytorch/pytorch,123257,bug,Setting output_size argument during forward breaks LazyConvTranspose,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

I get an error when running the following snippet on PyTorch version 2.2.2 but not on 2.1.0:
```The code imports necessary modules from PyTorch, initializes a tensor `x` with random values, creates a `LazyConvTranspose2d` layer with 64 output channels and kernel size 2x2, and attempts to apply the layer to `x` with a specified output size of (33, 33). This results in an error in PyTorch version 2.2.2 but works without error in version 2.1.0.```
Here is the traceback for ver. 2.2.2:
```The log shows a `TypeError` raised when attempting to call `_LazyConvXdMixin.initialize_parameters()` with an unexpected keyword argument `output_size`. The error occurs within the PyTorch module system during the initialization of a convolutional layer.```
Same thing also happens when using 1d or 3d versions of LazyConvTranspose.

I also noticed that passing output_size as positional argument breaks things in both versions (maybe this happens in other versions also, but I haven't tested them):
```The code imports necessary modules from PyTorch, initializes a 4D tensor `x`, creates a `LazyConvTranspose2d` layer with 64 output channels and kernel size 2x2, and attempts to apply the layer to `x` with output shape (33, 33), which results in an error.```

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the problem description.

The user reported that when they tried to use `nn.LazyConvTranspose2d` with an `output_size` argument during the forward pass, it threw a TypeError. They provided a code snippet where calling `module(input, output_size=(...))` resulted in an error because the `initialize_parameters` method didn't accept the necessary arguments.

Looking at the patches, two changes were made:

1. In the test cases, new tests (`test_lazy_conv_transpose1d_kwargs`, etc.) were added that pass `output_size` as a keyword argument to `_check_lazy_conv`. This suggests that the testing framework now correctly handles cases where such arguments are passed during the forward pass.

2. The method `initialize_parameters` was modified to accept `*args` and `**kwargs`, allowing it to handle additional parameters like `output_size`.

These changes indicate that the original issue was due to a missing functionality or an oversight in how parameters were handled. Specifically, the `LazyConvTranspose` modules couldn't process keyword arguments necessary for proper operation during initialization.

Since the problem was resolved by updating the method signatures and tests to accommodate these arguments, it confirms that there was indeed a bug in the codebase. The inability to pass required parameters like `output_size` without causing an error is a clear defect, which fits under the ""bug"" label.
</think>

The issue was caused by a missing ability to handle keyword arguments during the initialization of lazy convolution transpose modules. The patches added support for these arguments and updated tests accordingly, confirming it as a bug.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Setting output_size argument during forward breaks LazyConvTranspose"". This suggests that there's an issue when using the output_size parameter with LazyConvTranspose modules in PyTorch. The word ""breaks"" indicates a problem or unexpected behavior, which aligns with a bug report.

Next, examining the body of the issue. The user provides code snippets showing that when they run their script on PyTorch 2.2.2, it throws an error, but not on version 2.1.0. They include a traceback pointing to a TypeError in initialize_parameters() where 'output_size' is an unexpected keyword argument.

The user also mentions similar issues with different versions and dimensions (1D, 3D), which suggests this isn't an isolated case. Additionally, trying to pass output_size as a positional argument causes errors across both versions tested, indicating a consistent problem.

They provided detailed environment information for both PyTorch versions, including CUDA setup and hardware specs, which is typical in bug reports to help reproduce the issue.

The presence of code snippets, error messages, version comparisons, and system details all point towards this being a genuine bug report. The user is clearly encountering unexpected behavior when using certain functionalities (LazyConvTranspose with output_size) across different versions of PyTorch.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" correctly categorizes this issue as it describes an unintended behavior in the software that needs to be addressed.

pytorch/pytorch,136090,enhancement,Tensor `isin` and `unique` missing bfloat16 support and half support on CPU,"### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

Noticed this odd gap in coverage when looking at optests: <URL>

Not sure why we don't have kernels build here for bfloat16 (or more types in CPU for that matter).

* This blocked by lack of GPU support for bfloat16 for unique, so I also added that in my fix PR

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional context

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, I'll look at the title: ""Tensor `isin` and `unique` missing bfloat16 support and half support on CPU."" So the issue is about adding support for certain data types (bfloat16 and half) on CPUs for these tensor functions. That sounds like a feature request because it's about expanding functionality to support more data types.

Next, I'll read the body of the issue. The user noticed missing coverage in tests and mentions that they added GPU support for bfloat16 in their fix PR. They also provided alternatives but didn't list any, so maybe there aren't other options. The context isn't extensive, but it's clear this is about adding new functionality.

Now looking at the patches. Patch 1 modifies a template to include BFloat16 and Half. Patches 2 through 7 adjust function calls and dispatchers to handle these types on CPU and CUDA. These changes are adding support where it was missing before, which is characteristic of enhancements or feature additions rather than bug fixes.

The label assigned is ""enhancement,"" which typically refers to new features or improvements. Since the issue is about adding support for more data types, this fits as an enhancement rather than a bug fix. Bug fixes usually address issues causing incorrect behavior, but here it's expanding functionality.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to enhancing functionality by adding support for new data types.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's look at the details provided.

First, the title of the issue is about missing support for bfloat16 and half on CPU in the `isin` and `unique` tensors. The body mentions that there's a gap in coverage noticed through some optests. It also states that kernels aren't built for these types, which the user isn't sure why. Additionally, it notes that this is blocked by a lack of GPU support for bfloat16 in unique, so a fix PR was added.

Now, considering what an ""enhancement"" label typically signifies. Enhancements are usually for new features or improvements to existing ones, not necessarily bug fixes. This issue seems to be pointing out missing functionality rather than a bug where something isn't working as intended.

The user is requesting that support be added for these data types on CPU, which would be an addition to the current capabilities. They're also mentioning their own fix PR, which suggests they are contributing new code to implement this feature. Since it's about adding support rather than fixing a broken feature, ""enhancement"" fits well here.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the issue as an enhancement.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" is appropriate because the issue is about adding missing functionality (support for bfloat16 and half on CPU), which fits the definition of an enhancement.

* ReflectionObject
* ReflectionParameter (2 leaks)
* ReflectionProperty

### Operating System

Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title of the issue: ""Memory leak in Reflection constructors"". That immediately tells me that the problem is related to memory not being properly released, which fits under a memory leak.

Next, I'll read through the body of the issue. The user provided some PHP code that when run results in a memory leak detection. They included the output showing that there was one memory leak detected. They also mentioned that they tested other Reflection classes like ReflectionExtension, ReflectionObject, and ReflectionParameter, which also had leaks. This confirms that the issue is indeed about memory not being freed correctly.

Now looking at the patches provided. There are several patches here. Patch 1 adds a note about fixing a bug related to a memory leak in Reflection constructors. The other patches (2 through 6) include changes to how certain reflection objects are constructed and destroyed, particularly around freeing references and parameters properly. For example, in Patch 2, there's code that releases strings and frees allocated memory when reflection objects are destroyed. This directly addresses preventing memory leaks by ensuring proper cleanup.

Additionally, the test cases added in Patches 3-6 check if double constructor calls on Reflection objects don't cause issues, which would prevent potential memory leaks from multiple initializations without proper cleanup.

Putting it all together: The issue title and body describe a memory leak, and the patches implement fixes that free allocated resources correctly. Therefore, the label ""memory leak"" is appropriate because both the problem described and the solution address memory management issues.
</think>

The label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects the issue as it deals with improper memory handling in Reflection constructors, confirmed by the provided description, test results, and patches.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to determine if the label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue described by its title and body. 

First, looking at the title: ""Memory leak in Reflection constructors"". That immediately suggests that there's an issue where memory isn't being properly released when using reflection classes.

Now, examining the body of the issue. The user provided a code snippet that creates a new ReflectionProperty instance and then calls __construct again on it. When they ran this script, they got an output indicating a memory leak with 16 bytes freed at a specific address, resulting in one detected leak. They expected no leaks but encountered them instead.

Additionally, the user mentioned testing other reflection classes like ReflectionExtension, ReflectionObject, ReflectionParameter (with two leaks), and ReflectionProperty, all of which also exhibited memory leaks. This indicates that the issue isn't isolated to just one class but affects multiple parts of the reflection API in PHP.

The PHP version is 8.5-dev, so this is a development version where such issues might still be present. The operating system field was left blank, but since the leak is consistent across multiple reflection classes, it's likely an issue with PHP itself rather than the OS.

Given all these details—the title clearly stating a memory leak, the code example showing an unexpected leak, and multiple affected classes—the label ""memory leak"" fits perfectly. There's no ambiguity here; the problem is directly related to memory not being freed properly when using reflection constructors.

nodejs/node,52159,bug,Recursive fs.readdirSync tries to recurse into Unix domain socket,"### Version

v21.7.1

### Platform

Darwin nathan-MacBook-Pro 23.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:31:00 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020 arm64

### Subsystem

fs

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

The following snippet will reproduce the bug on macOS and Linux; I'm not able to test it on Windows:

```This code snippet removes and creates a directory, sets up a Unix domain socket server, and logs the files in the directory both non-recursively and recursively.```

### How often does it reproduce? Is there a required condition?

It reproduces consistently for me.

### What is the expected behavior? Why is that the expected behavior?

I would expect to see output like the following:

```The log indicates that in both non-recursive and recursive searches, the file `file.sock` was found.```

In both the recursive and non-recursive case, listing a directory with a single file in it should produce an array containing that file's name.

### What do you see instead?

Instead, I see the following output:

```The log indicates that an attempt was made to read the directory contents of `dir/file.sock`, but it failed because `dir/file.sock` is not a directory. The error occurred while trying to read files in a non-recursive manner, and the specific file that caused the issue is `file.sock`.```

### Additional information

For some reason, it's treating a Unix domain socket as a directory and it tries to call `scandir` on it, which is clearly not valid.

To confirm that `dir/file.sock` created by the above script is indeed a socket, I ran the following (output shown below the command):

```The log indicates that `dir/file.sock` is identified as a socket file.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report based on the provided information.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""Recursive fs.readdirSync tries to recurse into Unix domain socket."" This immediately suggests that there's an unexpected behavior happening when using a specific function in Node.js. The word ""tries to recurse"" implies that something is going wrong during the execution, which points towards a bug.

Moving on to the body of the report. The user provided steps to reproduce the issue, including code snippets and error messages. They mentioned that running this code consistently causes an ENOTDIR error because fs.readdirSync with recursive set to true attempts to treat a Unix domain socket as a directory. This is clearly not expected behavior—sockets shouldn't be treated as directories by file system functions.

The user also provided the expected output, which is just listing the socket file without any issues, and what they actually saw was an error because the function tried to scan the socket as if it were a directory. This discrepancy indicates a problem with how Node.js handles certain file types when using recursive readdir.

Looking at the patches that resolved this issue: 

Patch 1 changes how the code checks if something is a directory, replacing a bitwise AND with S_ISDIR, which is more standard and reliable. Similarly, Patch 2 corrects another condition to properly check for directories using S_IFMT and S_IFDIR. These changes suggest that the original code had incorrect checks for directories, leading it to mistakenly treat sockets as such.

Patch 3 adds a test case to ensure this behavior doesn't regress. It creates a server with a Unix domain socket and attempts to read the directory recursively without crashing or causing errors, which directly addresses the issue reported.

Considering all of these factors—the unexpected error when using recursive readdir on a directory containing a socket, the patches fixing how directories are checked, and the addition of a test case—it's clear that this was indeed a bug in Node.js. The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem described because it involves incorrect functionality that was fixed with specific code changes.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me read through everything carefully.

First, the title is ""Recursive fs.readdirSync tries to recurse into Unix domain socket."" That immediately tells me that there's an issue with how the function is handling a specific type of file, in this case, a Unix domain socket.

Looking at the body, the user provided steps to reproduce the bug. They set up a server that listens on a socket file and then try to read the directory both non-recursively and recursively using fs.readdirSync. The expected behavior was just to list 'file.sock' in both cases without issues. Instead, when using the recursive option, it throws an ENOTDIR error because it's trying to treat the socket as a directory.

They also confirmed that 'dir/file.sock' is indeed a socket file and not a directory by running the `file` command. This indicates that the problem isn't with their setup but likely with how Node.js's fs module handles such files when recursion is enabled.

The key here is understanding what the expected behavior should be. The user expects readdirSync, even in recursive mode, to simply list the socket file without attempting to read it as a directory since it's not one. However, the function is trying to recurse into it, which leads to an error because sockets aren't directories.

So, this issue points out that there's a flaw in how Node.js handles certain files when using recursive directory reading. Since it consistently reproduces and the expected behavior isn't met, labeling this as a ""bug"" makes sense because it's an unintended behavior causing errors where it shouldn't.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue described. The problem arises from unexpected behavior in Node.js's fs.readdirSync when handling a Unix domain socket, which is not a directory but is being treated as such during recursion.

We can clean up this error message, because it's an expected result of a panic in any unit test, and re-enable the test-panic-abort tests. We just need to add a match arm with `#[cfg(target_os = ""fuchsia"")]` that detects the failure code used for fuchsia (-1028) and returns TestResult::TrFailed with no message.








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

First, the title of the issue is ""Fix panic=abort tests on Fuchsia."" That clearly mentions ""panic,"" which relates to testing abort scenarios in Rust, probably when a test panics and needs to handle it gracefully.

Looking at the body, it explains that certain tests were disabled because they failed due to an error message. The error came from a specific line in the library/test code where a panic occurs. The solution proposed is to clean up this error by handling the exit code specific to Fuchsia and re-enabling the tests. So the issue is about properly handling panics in tests on Fuchsia.

Now, examining the patches: 

Patch 1 adds a constant for the Fuchsia-specific return code (-1028) and modifies how test results are determined. It checks if the exit code matches this specific value and returns TrFailed without a message, which I assume is meant to handle the panic gracefully instead of showing an error.

Patches 2 and 3 seem to adjust the line numbers in the test files where the panics occur. This suggests that the tests were failing because the expected behavior wasn't correctly handled on Fuchsia, so adjusting where the panic is thrown or caught might fix the test execution.

Putting it all together: The issue is about fixing tests related to panics (specifically when aborting) on Fuchsia by properly handling their exit codes. The label ""panic"" captures this essence because the problem revolves around how panics in tests are managed and reported, especially ensuring that such cases don't cause unintended failures or error messages.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the issue report.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me read through the title and body carefully.

The title is ""Fix panic=abort tests on Fuchsia."" That immediately tells me that the issue is related to panic handling in Rust tests, specifically on the Fuchsia operating system. The word ""panic"" here refers to how Rust handles panics, which are runtime errors that cause the program to crash.

Looking at the body, it explains that certain tests were disabled because they were failing due to a specific error message. The error mentions an exit code of -1028 (ZX_TASK_RETCODE_EXCEPTION_KILL), which comes from a line in libtest. The issue suggests cleaning up this error and re-enabling the tests by adding a configuration for Fuchsia that handles this failure code, returning TestResult::TrFailed with no message.

The label assigned is ""panic."" Since the entire issue revolves around fixing how panic=abort tests behave on Fuchsia, specifically addressing errors related to panic handling in test environments, the label seems appropriate. The problem is directly tied to panics and their handling, so using the ""panic"" label makes sense for categorization.

I don't see any other prominent themes here; it's not about performance or a new feature, just fixing how tests handle panics on a specific OS. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""panic"" is appropriate because the issue focuses on handling panic-related test failures on Fuchsia.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41938,metrics,Upgrade to Dropwizard Metrics 4.2.27,,1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""metrics"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. The issue title is ""Upgrade to Dropwizard Metrics 4.2.27"", and the body is empty. So, from the title alone, it's clear that the issue is about upgrading a library related to metrics.

Looking at the patch provided, it changes the version of ""Dropwizard Metrics"" from 4.2.26 to 4.2.27 in a build file. This confirms that the issue was indeed about updating the Metrics library.

The label assigned is ""metrics"". Since Dropwizard Metrics is a metrics-related library and the issue involves upgrading its version, the label seems relevant. It categorizes the issue under metrics, which makes sense because it's directly related to the functionality or dependency of metrics in the project.

I don't see any reason why this label wouldn't fit. The title and patch both point towards a metrics-related change, so using the ""metrics"" label accurately reflects the content of the issue.
</think>

The label ""metrics"" is appropriate because the issue involves upgrading Dropwizard Metrics, which is directly related to metrics functionality.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""metrics"" is accurate for a GitHub issue titled ""Upgrade to Dropwizard Metrics 4.2.27"". The body of the issue is empty, so all I have to go on is the title.

First, I'll break down the title. It's about an upgrade, specifically to version 4.2.27 of Dropwizard Metrics. Dropwizard Metrics is a library used for collecting application metrics in Java applications. So, the issue is clearly related to updating this library to a newer version.

Now, considering the label ""metrics"". Since the title mentions Dropwizard Metrics, which directly relates to the functionality of metrics collection and monitoring, it makes sense that the label would be ""metrics"". The issue is about improving or updating the metrics tool, so the label accurately reflects the content.

I don't see any other aspects here. There's no mention of bugs, new features, or other categories, just an upgrade to a specific library related to metrics. Therefore, the label ""metrics"" seems appropriate and accurate for this issue.

denoland/deno,26313,build,Build fails Next.js static exports,"Build fails when using [static exports](<URL> in Next.js.

```The log shows that a build task for a Next.js 14.2.15 project was executed successfully, but encountered an error during the generation of static pages. Specifically, the build failed because it could not find the file `/Users/moriken/Developer/next-app/out/_next/static/css/9de320161955c026.css`, resulting in a ""No such file or directory"" error.```

After that, the relevant file is existing, which suggests that a race condition is occurring [here](<URL> 
It works fine in Node.js 22.9.0.

Version: Deno 2.0.0
Environment: M1 Mac 14.6.1

## Reproduction Steps

1. Create a new Next.js app with Deno

    ```The code snippet creates a new Next.js project using the `create-next-app` tool with Deno and the latest version from npm.```

1. Set [output to `""export""`](<URL> in next.config.js

1. Build

    ```The code snippet shows that running a `build` task using Deno version 2.0.0 fails, while the same task successfully runs with Node.js version 22.9.0.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""build"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the issue's title, body, and the provided patches.

The title is ""Build fails Next.js static exports."" That immediately tells me that the problem occurs during the build process when using static exports in Next.js. 

Looking at the body, the user describes a build failure with an error message indicating a file not found during the static pages generation. They mention it works fine on Node.js 22.9.0 but fails on Deno 2.0.0. The error points to a race condition in the `recursive-copy.ts` file. 

The patches provided are modifications to functions related to copying files. Patch 1 adjusts how errors are handled when a file isn't found, specifically for both asynchronous and synchronous copy operations. It adds conditional checks to only throw an error if it's not a ""NotFound"" case, which suggests it's trying to handle race conditions where the file might exist by the time the error is processed.

Patch 2 introduces new tests for `copyFile` with the `COPYFILE_EXCL` flag. These tests check that copying a file when the destination already exists throws an appropriate error, ensuring exclusive copy behavior works as expected.

So, the issue revolves around a build failure due to file handling during static exports. The patches modify how files are copied and tested, directly addressing the race condition causing the build to fail. 

The label ""build"" is assigned because the problem occurs during the build process. However, I think a more specific label like ""bug"" or ""race-condition"" might be better, but since the options aren't given, I have to assess if ""build"" captures the essence.

Given that the issue is about the build failing and the patches fix the build process, the label ""build"" does accurately reflect the problem. It's a high-level category that correctly groups this type of issue.
</think>

The issue pertains to a build failure during static exports in Next.js, with patches addressing file handling errors causing the build to fail. The label ""build"" is appropriate as it directly relates to the build process issues described.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""build"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading the title and body of the issue.

The title is ""Build fails Next.js static exports."" So immediately, it mentions a build failure related to Next.js static exports. That suggests that during the build process, something goes wrong when exporting statically.

Looking at the body, the user describes that the build fails when using static exports in Next.js. They provided an error log showing a build error with a specific file not found. The error message points to an issue where the system can't find a CSS file, which might be due to a race condition as mentioned.

They also mention that this works fine on Node.js 22.9.0 but fails on Deno 2.0.0. They provided reproduction steps involving creating a Next.js app with Deno, setting the output to ""export,"" and then trying to build it.

Now, considering the label assigned is ""build."" The issue revolves around the build process failing when using static exports with specific environments. The problem arises during the build step, as indicated by the console logs and the user's description of the error occurring after generating static pages but before completion.

So, since the primary issue is related to the build process failing under certain conditions, labeling it ""build"" seems accurate because it directly pertains to issues encountered during building the application. There might be other relevant labels like ""static-exports"" or ""Deno,"" but ""build"" captures the essence of the problem as described.

Therefore, I conclude that the label accurately reflects the issue.

facebook/react-native,45502,rendering,Inspector Tools issue when view are transformed in Fabric,"### Description

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""rendering"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report and the patches applied. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Inspector Tools issue when view are transformed in Fabric."" It mentions Inspector Tools and views being transformed, which relates to how elements are displayed and inspected.

In the body, the user explains that when using vertical inversion, the wrong element is highlighted because `findNodeAtPoint` isn't accounting for the transform. This affects both iOS and Android. The steps to reproduce involve toggling the element inspector and selecting an item, where the expected highlight doesn't match the actual one.

The patches provided are in C++ files. Patch 1 modifies the `findNodeAtPoint` function by adjusting how points are calculated when there's a vertical or horizontal inversion. It includes adding transformations and normalizing coordinates based on the center of the frame. This suggests that the issue is about correctly mapping touch points to elements, especially under transformations.

Patch 2 adds a test case for an inverted list, checking if the correct element is found at specific points after applying a vertical inversion transform. This indicates that the problem lies in how the inspector tool calculates which node is under the pointer when views are transformed.

Patch 3 updates functions `isVerticalInversion` and `isHorizontalInversion` to use float comparison instead of direct equality checks, ensuring accurate detection of inversions.

The original label was ""rendering,"" but the issue isn't about how elements are rendered visually. Instead, it's about the inspector tool correctly identifying elements when transformations are applied. The core problem affects the interaction and inspection tools rather than the visual rendering pipeline.

So, I think the correct labels should relate to ""inspector"" or ""tools"" since the problem is with the element inspector not working as expected due to transform issues.
</think>

The issue revolves around the Inspector Tools incorrectly identifying elements when transformations are applied. The patches address how touch points are calculated under such transforms, affecting the tool's functionality rather than rendering.

Answer: 0",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out whether the label ""rendering"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. So, the title of the issue is about an ""Inspector Tools issue when views are transformed in Fabric."" The body explains that when certain transformations like Vertical Inversion are applied, the element inspector doesn't work correctly because it highlights the wrong item.

Hmm, so the problem is with the inspector tool not correctly identifying elements after a transformation. I remember that the inspector uses functions like findNodeAtPoint to determine which element is under the cursor or touch point. If transformations aren't being accounted for in this function, the inspector might be calculating the position incorrectly, leading to wrong elements being highlighted.

Now, considering the label ""rendering."" Rendering issues usually relate to how elements are drawn on the screen—like incorrect layouts, missing elements, or visual glitches. But in this case, the problem isn't about rendering itself but rather about the inspector tool's functionality when transformations are applied.

The issue seems more related to a bug in the Fabric renderer's handling of transformed views concerning the inspector tool. It might fall under categories like ""bug,"" ""fabric,"" or maybe ""tools"" since it affects how tools interact with rendered elements, not the rendering itself.

So, even though the problem occurs within the context of transformations which are part of the rendering pipeline, the core issue is about the inspector's accuracy after such transformations. Therefore, labeling it as ""rendering"" might be a bit off because the main problem isn't the rendering but the tool's interaction with the rendered elements.

I think the correct labels should relate more to the tools or the Fabric architecture rather than rendering. So, in this case, the label ""rendering"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue described.

pingcap/tidb,54324,bug,select from information_schema.CLUSTER_SLOW_QUERY panic,"## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)



This is reported by one of our user:

```The SQL query selects aggregated metrics from the `information_schema.cluster_SLOW_QUERY` table for queries executed between '2024-06-24 10:20:00' and '2024-06-24 10:30:00', filtered by internal status and coprocessor address. It groups the results by `user` and `digest`, orders them by `Total_keys` in descending order, and limits the output to the top 10 rows. The query encounters an error due to a panic in the RPC server handling the coprocessor, specifically a runtime error with an index out of range issue.```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Query success

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Query failed

The panic stack is this:

```The log indicates a warning and an informational message related to a database operation failure. The warning occurred at `[2024/06/24 12:33:25.051 +08:00]` and suggests that there was an ""other error"" during a coprocessor handling process by the RPC server. The error message includes a runtime index out of range issue at index 8192. This error originated from `coprocessor.go:1187`. The informational message at `[2024/06/24 12:33:25.052 +08:00]` confirms that the command dispatch failed for a specific connection, detailing the SQL query and the exact error encountered, which aligns with the previous warning.```

The real panic stack is this one:

```The log indicates that a panic occurred in the TiDB RPC server while handling a coprocessor request. The panic originated from the `readLastLines` function in `slow_query.go`, which is part of the TiDB executor module. The stack trace shows a series of function calls leading up to the panic, involving components such as slow query retrieval, file time retrieval, and coprocessor handling.```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)



v6.5.3
",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""select from information_schema.CLUSTER_SLOW_QUERY panic"". The word ""panic"" here suggests that something went wrong, possibly a crash or an unexpected error in the system. That definitely sounds like a bug because it's an unintended behavior causing the program to fail.

Next, the body of the report provides more details. There's a SQL query provided that's causing an error with code 1105, which is ""other error: panic when RPC server handling coprocessor"". The user expected the query to succeed but instead got this panic error. This indicates that there's a problem in how the system handles certain queries, leading to a crash. That’s a clear sign of a bug.

Then, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies the `readLastLines` function in `slow_query.go`. It changes a loop condition and some bounds checking. The original code had a loop that might have gone out of bounds, which could cause an index error. By adjusting the loop to run until `len(chars)-1` and adding proper checks for newline characters without exceeding array limits, this patch likely fixes an issue where accessing an invalid index was causing a panic.

Patch 2 adds a test case named `TestIssue54324`, which seems to verify that reading specific file sizes doesn't cause panics. This suggests that the original problem was related to how files were read, possibly leading to buffer overflows or incorrect indexing when handling large files, which aligns with the index out of range error mentioned in the issue.

Putting it all together: The issue is about a panic occurring during a specific SQL query, and the patches address potential index errors and add tests to prevent such panics. This clearly points to an unintended behavior in the code, so labeling it as a bug makes sense.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report because it describes an unexpected error causing a system panic, and the provided patches fix the underlying indexing issues that led to the crash.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""select from information_schema.CLUSTER_SLOW_QUERY panic."" The word ""panic"" here suggests that something went wrong in the system, likely an unexpected error or crash. That's a strong indicator of a bug since panics usually mean unhandled errors.

Now, moving to the body. The user provided a detailed bug report with steps to reproduce, expected and actual outcomes, panic stack traces, and even their TiDB version (v6.5.3). They included a SQL query that caused an error when run. The error message is ""other error: panic when RPC server handling coprocessor, stack: runtime error: index out of range [8192] with length 8192."" This clearly points to an index out of bounds issue in the code, which is a programming bug.

The user also provided two different stack traces. The first one seems related to coprocessor handling, and the second trace goes deeper into the code, showing where exactly the panic occurred—in functions like readLastLines, getFileEndTime, etc. These are internal functions, suggesting that the problem isn't with user input but with how TiDB is processing data internally.

The fact that a specific query is causing a panic indicates that there's an issue in the code handling that particular SQL operation. The error occurs when accessing an index beyond the array or slice length, which is a common programming mistake leading to crashes.

Since all these elements—error occurrence, stack traces pointing to internal functions, and a reproducible scenario—are present, it's clear this isn't just user error but a flaw in the software itself. Therefore, labeling it as a ""bug"" is accurate because it represents an unintended behavior causing the system to crash or produce incorrect results.

I don't see any information suggesting this is a feature request, usage question, or something else. It's purely about unexpected behavior that needs fixing.

![image](<URL>

What I would've expected is something closer to this (an unstable non-`const` function):
![image](<URL>

For reference, functions stable in non-`const` contexts but unstable in `const` contexts look like this:
![image](<URL>








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""layout"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Confusing rustdoc layout for `const` functions that are unstable even in non-`const` contexts."" The word ""layout"" is right there in the title, which suggests that the problem is related to how something looks or is arranged in the documentation. So that's a hint that the label might be appropriate.

Now, the body of the issue includes some images. From what I can gather without seeing them, the user is pointing out that the rustdoc (Rust's documentation generator) is displaying `const` functions in a way that's confusing. They provide examples of what they found versus what they expected. This implies that the issue is about the visual presentation or structure of the documentation, which again ties into layout.

Next, looking at the patches provided to fix this issue. There are five patches, and I'll try to understand what each does without getting too deep into the code.

Patch 1 seems to modify how constness is determined in the code. It changes a condition that checks if a function is both `const` and not unstable, to now include cases where it's either `const` or unstable. This affects whether the function is marked as `Const` or `NotConst`. So this might influence how rustdoc displays these functions.

Patch 2 updates imports to include `StableSince`, which suggests that stability information (like since which version a feature is stable) will now be considered in the documentation rendering.

Patch 3 modifies the `print_constness_with_space` function. It changes how constness and stability are printed. Previously, it checked if the function was `const` and had some stability status. Now, it seems to handle cases where a function is unstable or stable differently, especially considering both overall stability and const stability. This directly affects the text output in the documentation.

Patch 4 adds debug information and modifies how `print_constness_with_space` is called by passing more parameters related to stability. Again, this ties into how the documentation displays function properties.

Patch 5 adds some test cases. One of them uses `#[rustc_const_unstable]`, which marks a const function as unstable. The tests check that certain spans don't appear in the generated HTML, indicating that the documentation isn't showing the 'since' version for these cases. This suggests that the patches are ensuring that unstable functions aren't marked with version info when they shouldn't be.

Putting it all together, the issue is about how rustdoc displays `const` functions, particularly those that are unstable. The confusion arises from the layout—how the stability and constness are presented. The patches adjust the conditions under which certain keywords or notes are displayed in the documentation, ensuring that the layout accurately reflects whether a function is stable or unstable, both in general and in its const context.

So, considering all this, the label ""layout"" does seem appropriate because the problem and solution revolve around how information is presented visually in the generated documentation. The changes aren't about adding new features or fixing bugs in functionality but rather improving how information is displayed to avoid confusion.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""layout"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Confusing rustdoc layout for `const` functions that are unstable even in non-`const` contexts."" The word ""layout"" is present here, which immediately suggests that the issue is about how something appears or is structured in the documentation. 

Now, examining the body of the issue. The user provided images and compared what they found with their expectations. They mentioned specific examples: one image showing the current layout they find confusing and another showing what they expected, which resembles a stable non-const function's appearance. There's also a reference to functions that are stable in non-const contexts but unstable in const contexts.

The user is clearly discussing how the documentation presents information about these functions. They're pointing out inconsistencies or confusion in how rustdoc displays stability information for const versus non-const functions. Their main concern seems to be with the visual presentation and layout of this information in the documentation, which affects their understanding.

So, the label ""layout"" fits because the issue is about the structure and appearance of the rustdoc pages. The user isn't reporting a bug in the code or functionality but rather how the documentation is laid out, making it confusing for users to understand the stability of certain functions.
</think>

The label ""layout"" accurately reflects the issue report as it concerns the structure and presentation of rustdoc documentation.

spring-projects/spring-framework,34119,bug,Dependency injection matches wildcards too leniently with 6.2.1,"Steps to reproduce:

1. Define two interfaces `ObjectPostProcessor  `and `AuthorizationManager`

```The code defines two interfaces:

1. `ObjectPostProcessor<T>` with a method `process(T t)` to process an object of type `T`.
2. `AuthorizationManager<T>` with a method `getValue()` to retrieve a value of type `T`.```


2. SimpleStart as config class

```The code defines a class `SimpleStart` that implements `ApplicationContextAware`. It declares two static methods annotated with `@Bean` to create instances of `ObjectPostProcessor`. The `setApplicationContext` method retrieves and prints an instance of one of these processors from the application context.```

```The log indicates an error while creating a bean named `simpleStart` because there are two beans of type `cn.hiboot.framework.research.spring.research.ObjectPostProcessor<java.lang.Object>` available, but the configuration expects only one.```

It does work well when I replaced `?`  with `Object`, I wonder if this scene needs to be supported in the future?

In Addition, I found that it was due to the change of #33982. But before that, it was good

Related to [SEC#16299](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label 'bug' is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Dependency injection matches wildcards too leniently with 6.2.1"". The word ""too leniently"" suggests that there's an issue where something isn't working as it should. That sounds like a bug because it's unexpected behavior.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user provided steps to reproduce the problem. They defined two interfaces and a config class. When they run their test, they get a BeanCreationException because Spring can't find a single matching bean when there are two available. This indicates that the dependency injection isn't working correctly, which points to a bug in how Spring handles these generics or wildcards.

The user also mentions that it worked before a specific change (#33982), implying that something was broken by an update, which is typical of regression bugs. They relate this issue to another one in Spring Security, further suggesting it's a problem within the framework.

Looking at the patches provided: they made changes to how ResolvableType handles generics and wildcards. The modifications include checking if types are assignable and handling unresolved type variables more strictly. These are code fixes aimed at correcting incorrect behavior, which is exactly what you do for bugs.

So putting it all together: the issue describes unexpected behavior causing errors, provides reproduction steps, links to prior changes that introduced the problem, and shows patches meant to fix incorrect handling of dependency injection with generics. All these elements point towards this being a bug rather than, say, an enhancement or feature request.
</think>

The label 'bug' accurately reflects the issue as it describes unexpected behavior in the framework's dependency injection system, provides steps to reproduce, links to prior changes that introduced the problem, and includes patches aimed at correcting the behavior.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's look at the title: ""Dependency injection matches wildcards too leniently with 6.2.1."" This suggests that there's an issue with how dependency injection is handling wildcards in version 6.2.1 of some software, likely Spring Framework given the context.

Now, examining the body of the issue. The user provides steps to reproduce, including code snippets. They define two interfaces: ObjectPostProcessor and AuthorizationManager, both generic. Then, they create a configuration class SimpleStart which implements ApplicationContextAware. In this class, they define two beans as ObjectPostProcessor<Object> and ObjectPostProcessor<AuthorizationManager<?>>. 

When the application runs, it throws a BeanCreationException because there are two qualifying beans of type ObjectPostProcessor<Object>, but only one is expected. The error message says it found two beans: objectObjectPostProcessor and authorizationManagerPostProcessor.

The user mentions that replacing '?' with 'Object' fixes the issue, implying that the wildcard was causing unexpected behavior. They also reference a specific change (#33982) which introduced this problem, indicating that prior to this change, everything worked fine.

So, putting it all together: The issue is about unexpected behavior in dependency injection when using wildcards, leading to multiple beans being found where only one was expected. This started after a particular code change and causes an exception. The user is asking if this scenario should be supported in the future.

A bug typically refers to unintended behavior that causes errors or exceptions, which seems to fit here because the application crashes due to the DI container finding more beans than it should. The problem arises from how generics and wildcards are handled during dependency injection, which wasn't an issue before a specific change. Therefore, this is indeed a bug rather than a feature request or other type of issue.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""[CI] LogsdbTestSuiteIT class failing"". This suggests that there's a problem with some test cases in the LogsdbTestSuiteIT class, which is part of the Continuous Integration (CI) process. So it's related to tests failing during CI builds.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. The user provided build scans and a reproduction command. They also mentioned that the failure occurs specifically on branch 8.16, with a failure rate of 3.7% in 54 executions for the class, and 100% fail rate in 2 executions for the pipeline. 

The key part is the failure message:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Failure at [/30_logsdb_default_mapping:522]: got unexpected warning header [
	299 Elasticsearch-8.16.0-5972cff67544c4464f02346acf93aed94647f270 ""index template [logs-template] has index patterns [logs-win-prod] matching patterns from existing older templates [global] with patterns (global => [*]); this template [logs-template] will take precedence during new index creation""
]
```
This shows that the test is failing due to an AssertionError. The error message indicates that there's an unexpected warning related to index templates in Elasticsearch.

Looking at the patches, each one modifies the allowed_warnings section of various test cases. For example, in Patch 1:
- The original line allowed a warning with patterns [logs-*-*].
- It was changed to allow a more specific pattern like [logs-http-prod].

So the patches are adjusting which warnings the tests expect, making them more specific instead of using wildcards. This suggests that the test was failing because it encountered an unexpected warning message that wasn't accounted for in the allowed_warnings list.

Now, considering what ""runtime error"" means: typically, a runtime error refers to an error that occurs during the execution of the program, such as exceptions or crashes. However, this issue is specifically about a test failure due to an assertion error caused by unexpected warnings, not a crash or exception in the code itself.

The label ""runtime error"" might be too broad here. The problem isn't a general runtime issue but rather a test failure because of unanticipated warnings during CI testing. A more accurate label might be something like ""test failure"" or ""CI issue,"" as it's specifically related to test cases failing due to unexpected conditions.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" doesn't precisely capture the nature of this problem. It was assigned but doesn't reflect that the issue is a test failure rather than an application crash or runtime exception.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" does not accurately reflect the issue because it's specifically about a test failure due to unexpected warnings, not a general runtime error.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

First, looking at the title: ""[CI] LogsdbTestSuiteIT class failing"". This indicates that a test suite is failing in the Continuous Integration (CI) environment. The fact that it's a test failure suggests there might be issues with either the code or the tests themselves.

Moving to the body of the issue, under ""Failure Message"", we see an `AssertionError`. The error message mentions an unexpected warning header from Elasticsearch during testing. Specifically, it's about an index template taking precedence over existing ones. This looks like a failure in an assertion within the test case, not necessarily a runtime error.

The term ""runtime error"" usually refers to issues that occur during the execution of the program, such as null pointer exceptions, division by zero, or out-of-memory errors. In this case, the problem is with a test failing due to an unexpected warning. The tests are in the `LogsdbTestSuiteIT` class, and they're expecting certain conditions which aren't met, hence the assertion failure.

The issue report also mentions that there have been 2 failures in the test suite across 54 executions, giving a 3.7% fail rate. This suggests it's an intermittent problem with the tests rather than a consistent runtime error in the codebase itself.

Additionally, under ""Issue Reasons"", it points out that the failure occurs during CI pipeline runs and specific to the `elasticsearch-periodic` pipeline, which is related to testing and integration processes. This further supports that it's a test failure rather than a general runtime issue.

So, considering all this, the label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately describe the problem. The issue is specifically about a failing test case due to an unexpected condition being triggered, not a runtime error in the application itself.
</think>

The label assigned is ""runtime error,"" but the issue describes a failing test case with an assertion error, not a runtime error. Therefore, the answer is:

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what a regression is in software terms. A regression usually means that a bug has been introduced or an existing feature has stopped working after some code changes, often as a result of new development or refactoring.

Looking at the issue title: ""[Queries as signals]: Signal Queries throws console errors when component is rendered as custom element"". This suggests that there's a problem with signal queries causing errors in specific circumstances, like using custom elements.

In the body, the user explains that when a component uses `contentQuery` and is rendered as a custom element, it breaks with console errors. They mention that this shouldn't happen because existing decorators return empty arrays or undefined. So, they're pointing out unexpected behavior that's causing errors.

The user also mentions that it's a regression, which implies that this was working before but now isn't. They provided environment details and a stackblitz link to reproduce the issue. The error message shows an undefined property being read, indicating something went wrong in how content queries are handled when using custom elements.

Now looking at the patches. Patch 1 removes an import related to EffectScheduler, which might not directly cause this issue but could be part of the fix. Patch 2 adjusts how `executeContentQueries` is called and modifies some imports. It looks like they're changing parameters passed into functions, possibly fixing incorrect references or ensuring proper initialization. Patch 3 adds a test case for dynamically created components, specifically checking that content queries return empty results when expected.

The key here is whether this issue represents a regression. The user states it's a regression because the behavior changed from correctly handling `contentChildren` and `contentChild` to now throwing errors. The patches seem to adjust how content queries are executed, possibly reverting or correcting changes that introduced the bug.

Since the problem arose after some code change (as indicated by the regression), and the patches aim to fix this unexpected behavior, labeling it as a regression makes sense.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[Queries as signals]: Signal Queries throws console errors when component is rendered as custom element."" It mentions a problem with signal queries causing errors in a specific scenario. That suggests something isn't working as expected, which could indicate a bug or regression.

Now, moving to the body of the issue. The user specifies that it's a regression by answering ""Yes"" to the question about whether this is a regression. So they're explicitly stating that this is a regression, which means it's a bug that was introduced in a recent change after the feature worked correctly before.

They describe that when using a custom element with `contentQuery`, console errors occur. They also mention that it shouldn't happen and that it should behave similarly to existing decorators like `@ContentChildren` and `@ContentChild`. This indicates that prior to some change, this behavior was correct but now is broken, which aligns with the definition of a regression.

The provided stack trace shows an error where a property is being read from undefined. This kind of error often points to unexpected behavior in code, supporting the idea that something has gone wrong recently.

Additionally, they've provided a minimal reproduction link and their environment details, which helps in diagnosing the issue but doesn't change the fact that it's a regression since the user already confirmed it.

So putting it all together: the title indicates an unexpected problem, the body explicitly states it's a regression, and the error suggests a bug that likely wasn't present before. Therefore, the label ""regression"" is appropriate here.
</think>

The label ""regression"" accurately reflects this issue as the user explicitly states it's a regression, indicating a bug introduced after previous functionality worked correctly.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that fixed it.

First, let's look at the issue itself. The title is ""Angular.dev Playground is broken."" That sounds like something isn't working as expected on the Angular playground site. In the body, the user mentions that when they navigate to the playground, the code doesn't populate in main.ts and game.html. They also provided a screenshot and an error log pointing to a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length'). This suggests there's a runtime error happening when trying to load or run something on the site.

The user marked it as a regression, which typically means that a bug was introduced in a recent change that wasn't present before. They also didn't provide an environment but linked directly to the playground, indicating it's a problem with the live site.

Now, looking at the patch provided. It modifies a Bazel build file, specifically a rule related to filtering external npm dependencies. The changes include adding a check for problematic transitive dependencies and adjusting how packages are routed into node_modules. This seems like an internal build or dependency management issue that could affect how the Angular playground is built or served.

The key here is whether this bug was introduced by a recent change (regression) or if it's a new issue without prior context. Since the user marked it as a regression, they believe it's a new problem caused by a change. The patches seem to address dependency routing issues, which could explain why the playground isn't loading correctly—maybe a missing or incorrect dependency is causing the code not to populate and the error to occur.

So, considering all this, the label ""regression"" fits because the bug appears to have been introduced after some changes, affecting functionality that was previously working. The patches aim to correct how dependencies are handled, which likely fixes the regression.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""Angular.dev Playground is broken."" That tells me something's wrong with the Angular playground site.

Now, checking the body of the issue. The user provided several details:

1. They mentioned that the code doesn't populate in `main.ts` and `game.html`. There's also a screenshot linked, which suggests they encountered a visual issue where the expected content isn't showing up.
   
2. Under ""Is this a regression?"" they answered ""Yes."" That directly indicates that the problem started after a change, implying it's a regression bug.

3. They provided an error log with a TypeError: ""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"" and a stack trace pointing to specific JavaScript files. This suggests there's an unhandled exception causing the issue, which is a clear sign of a bug that wasn't present before.

4. The environment section didn't have a response, but the presence of the error log compensates for that by showing where the problem occurs.

Since the user confirmed it's a regression and provided evidence supporting this (the error and the broken functionality), the label ""regression"" fits well here. A regression means a bug introduced after previous versions were stable, which aligns with their report.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39466,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring Security 6.1.7,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, the title of the issue is ""Upgrade to Spring Security 6.1.7"". That immediately tells me that the issue is about updating a dependency in the project. The body is empty, so there's no additional context there, but the patches provided are crucial.

Looking at Patch 1, I see that it modifies a line in what looks like a build configuration file (maybe Gradle or Maven). The change is from ""6.1.7-SNAPSHOT"" to ""6.1.7"". This indicates that they're moving away from a snapshot version, which is typically a development or unstable version, to a stable release.

So the action here is clearly about upgrading a dependency (Spring Security) from a SNAPSHOT version to a released version. The label ""dependency upgrade"" fits because it's specifically about updating the version of a library used in the project. There's no mention of new features, bug fixes outside of dependencies, or other types of changes that might require different labels like ""bug fix"" or ""feature request"".

I don't see any reason to doubt this labeling. The title and patch both point directly to a dependency upgrade without any ambiguity.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to upgrading a project dependency.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the GitHub issue with the title ""Upgrade to Spring Security 6.1.7"" and an empty body. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the title: it clearly states an intention or request to upgrade to a specific version of Spring Security, which is a security framework often used in Java applications. The action here is about moving from one version of a dependency to another.

Next, I consider what ""dependency upgrade"" means as a label. In software projects, dependencies refer to external libraries or modules that the project relies on. Upgrading these would mean updating them to a newer version for various reasons like security patches, new features, or performance improvements.

The title is straightforward and doesn't mention any other aspects like bugs, feature requests, or documentation issues. It's solely focused on moving to Spring Security 6.1.7, which aligns with the idea of upgrading a dependency.

Even though the body is empty, the title provides enough context. The label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to updating an existing library to a newer version.

I don't see any conflicting information or reasons why this wouldn't fit under dependency upgrade. There's no mention of issues beyond just upgrading, so other labels like bug or feature request aren't applicable here.

Therefore, I conclude that the label accurately reflects the issue report.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" is appropriate because the title explicitly mentions updating to a specific version of Spring Security, indicating an update to a project dependency. The empty body doesn't provide additional context, but the title alone suffices for this classification.

FuelLabs/sway,6320,unsoundness,Incorrect function purity check,"Reclassify to High

From <URL>

# Brief/Intro
check_function_purity incorrectly checks the function's purity, allowing a function with only a storage(read) to potentially modify the state.

# Vulnerability Details
check_function_purity recursively traverses all reachable instructions within the function and the functions it calls to verify the correctness of the storage read write tags marked on the function. However, during the verification of the asm block, it incorrectly identifies the scwq instruction as a read operation, leading to an erroneous verification result.
```This code snippet iterates over the operations in an assembly block and updates tuples tracking read and write operations based on the operation name. It uses pattern matching to determine whether an operation reads from or writes to memory, updating the respective tuple accordingly.```
Aside from the bug, we think doing storage checks statically is not a good idea. It is possible for a read-only function to call another contract, which then calls a write function in the original contract. This breaks the read-only assumption of read abi functions, but does not violate any checks. It is possible to refine the checks, but there are too many moving parts in the cross contract call for precise checking. For example, ldc is another instruction which can affect purity of functions. It will be easier if the fuel-vm maintains a flag to check against storage mutations during runtime, which is what ethereum does.

# Impact Details
It is hard to precisely estimate the impact of an incorrect purity check because it depends on the code the user writes. In the best-case scenario, benign developers can also unknowingly call storage modifying functions in read-only functions and change the contract storage. This is arguably the developer's fault, but it presents an opportunity where the sway compiler fails to deliver the promise of function purity checks, and may misdirect developers into thinking their code is fine. In the worst-case scenario, malicious developers can exploit this incorrect check to fool users into calling a function deemed read-only, but actually modifies the state, and leverage it to steal funds.

To be honest, we are not sure what impact is appropriate for this kind of ""missing checks"" bugs. Because in the end, developers must have made a mistake to even have a chance to set off, or in this case, not set off the compilation errors checks. But because the sway team repeatedly said they think cei-analysis and storage purity checks correctness are important, we think this qualifies as a critical bug.

# References
<URL>


# Proof of Concept
Tests are run on sway commit acded67b3ec77ce1753356ad46f7ae17290f2ee0.

Compiler should refuse to compile clear_storage function, however, due to the incorrect check, below test case will successfully run.
```The code snippet defines a smart contract with a storage variable `a` and an ABI method `test`. It includes an implementation of the `test` method that clears storage. There is a function `clear_storage` marked with `#[storage(read)]` which is intended to read from storage but attempts to write to it using assembly, causing a compile-time error due to incorrect attribute usage. The `test` function at the end calls `c.test()` to invoke the ABI method.```
We omit writing a dapp to show loss of funds caused by this bug, because the fuel team said we only need to show the incorrect compilation with our PoC in the changelog walkthrough earlier.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects the given issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is about.

The issue seems to be related to some patches made in a repository, likely involving a programming language or compiler project. The title mentions an issue report with several patches and a label assigned as ""unsoundness."" My task is to see if that label fits based on the provided information.

First, I should understand what ""unsoundness"" means in this context. In programming languages and type theory, unsoundness refers to a situation where a type system or other safety mechanisms allow operations that can lead to runtime errors or violate the expected safety properties. This is a serious issue because it undermines the reliability of the language.

Looking at the patches provided, I see several changes across different files. The first few patches seem to adjust dependencies and build configurations, which don't immediately indicate unsoundness. However, starting from patch 66, there are changes in trait implementations and function attributes related to storage.

Patch 66 introduces a struct S with an implementation of trait A. The function f() is annotated with #[storage(read)], and it loads a state using __state_load_word(). Then, an Abi trait defines test(), which calls S{}.g(). This might be where the problem arises because if g() isn't properly annotated or interacts incorrectly with storage attributes, it could lead to unsound behavior.

Patch 67 shows that in category ""fail,"" there's a check related to pure functions accessing storage. The error message suggests that function g() is pure but tries to access storage through self.f(). Since f() has #[storage(read)], calling it from a pure function without the proper attributes could indeed cause unsoundness, as the type system isn't enforcing the necessary constraints.

Other patches adjust comments and checks in test cases, possibly ensuring that certain operations are correctly optimized or validated. These might be part of fixing the unsoundness by adding proper annotations or checks to prevent invalid storage accesses.

The key point here is that if a function marked as pure (without storage attributes) calls another function that does have storage side effects, it can bypass the type system's guarantees. This would allow operations that should be prohibited, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior, which fits the definition of unsoundness.

Therefore, the label ""unsoundness"" seems appropriate because the issue revolves around ensuring the type system correctly enforces storage access rules and preventing functions from accessing storage in ways that violate their declared purity.
</think>

The label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects this issue report because it involves violations of the type system's safety guarantees due to improper storage access annotations, which can lead to runtime errors.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's understand what ""unsoundness"" means in this context. In programming languages and compilers, unsoundness refers to a situation where a type system or a compiler allows code that should be rejected according to the language's specifications. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior because the system doesn't enforce the rules it's supposed to.

Looking at the issue title: ""Incorrect function purity check."" Function purity generally refers to whether a function has side effects, like modifying state. A correct purity check ensures that functions marked as read-only don't actually write to storage or have other side effects.

The body of the issue explains that the `check_function_purity` function isn't correctly verifying if a function is pure. Specifically, it incorrectly identifies certain assembly instructions (like scwq) as read operations when they might actually modify state. This means the compiler allows functions that should be marked as impure to pass as pure.

The impact section mentions that this bug could allow malicious developers to create functions that appear read-only but actually modify state. This misleads users and can lead to security issues, like stealing funds. The proof of concept shows a test case where a function with `#[storage(read)]` compiles even though it modifies storage using an asm block.

Now, tying this back to the label ""unsoundness."" Since the compiler is failing to enforce the purity constraints correctly, allowing impure functions to be considered pure, this directly points to a flaw in the type system or static checks. The issue isn't just about a bug; it's about the system being unsound because it doesn't uphold its guarantees.

Therefore, the label ""unsoundness"" is appropriate here because it accurately captures the nature of the problem—the compiler's inability to correctly enforce function purity, leading to potential runtime issues that should have been caught statically.

php/php-src,17047,memory leak,UAF on iconv filter failure,"### Description

The following code:

```This PHP code defines constants, functions, and filters a string through multiple iconv and rot13 filters before echoing the result. It also demonstrates the use of a closure and exception handling.```

Resulted in this output:
```The log indicates an `AddressSanitizer` error due to a heap-use-after-free issue. Specifically:

- The program reads from a freed memory location at address `0x60400004bc7c`.
- The memory was previously allocated but has been freed.
- The problematic code is located in `php_stream_bucket_delref` at line 152 of `filter.c`.
- The error occurs in the context of handling iconv stream filters and reading from a stream.

But I expected this output instead:

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""memory leak"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""UAF on iconv filter failure."" UAF stands for Use-After-Free, which is a type of memory-related bug where a program accesses memory after it has been freed. This isn't exactly a memory leak, which is when memory is allocated but not properly released, leading to gradual memory consumption.

Next, the body of the issue provides a PHP script that triggers an error. The output shows an AddressSanitizer error indicating a heap-use-after-free at a specific address. This confirms that the bug is related to accessing memory after it's been freed, which aligns with a UAF vulnerability rather than a memory leak.

Looking at the patches applied, they modify how errors are handled in the iconv stream filter. Specifically, they change the error handling by returning PSFS_ERR_FATAL instead of using a goto statement that might leave some resources unreleased. This suggests that the problem was improper error handling leading to accessing buckets after they were freed, not an issue where memory wasn't being freed at all.

Patch 1 adds a note about fixing bug GH-17047 related to UAF in iconv filters. Patch 2 adjusts how errors are handled, ensuring that buckets are properly delref'ed before returning, preventing the use-after-free scenario. Patch 3 introduces a test case that triggers the issue and expects a warning related to an invalid multibyte sequence, which is consistent with an error during iconv conversion but not memory leakage.

So putting it all together: the bug is about accessing memory after it's been freed (UAF), not about memory leaking. Therefore, the label ""memory leak"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue. The correct label should relate to use-after-free or UAF.
</think>

The label ""memory leak"" does not accurately describe this issue. The problem is a Use-After-Free vulnerability, not a memory leak.

0",0,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""memory leak"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the details provided.

The issue is titled ""UAF on iconv filter failure."" UAF typically stands for Use After Free, which is a type of memory corruption bug where a program accesses memory after it has been freed. This can lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities because the memory might have been reused by other parts of the program.

Looking at the body of the issue, there's a PHP script that causes an error when run. The output shows an AddressSanitizer report indicating a heap-use-after-free at a specific address. The stack trace points to functions related to stream filters, particularly in the iconv extension. The error occurs during the php_stream_bucket_delref function call.

The key part here is that the AddressSanitizer detected a use after free scenario. This means that some memory was freed but then accessed again, which is exactly what a UAF bug is. 

Now, considering the label assigned to this issue: ""memory leak."" A memory leak refers to situations where memory allocated is not properly released, leading to increased memory usage over time. However, in this case, the problem isn't about memory not being freed but rather accessing memory that has already been freed.

Therefore, the correct label should relate to a use after free issue, not a memory leak. The term ""memory leak"" doesn't accurately describe the bug reported here. So, the assigned label is incorrect.
</think>

The issue describes a Use After Free (UAF) bug, which is different from a memory leak. Therefore, the label ""memory leak"" does not accurately reflect the problem.

pytorch/pytorch,136291,bug,"On AMD GPUs (ROCm 5.7-6.2), cannot backpropagate loss tensor containing more than `2e8` elements","### 🐛 Describe the bug

In the following code, I am encountering a `HIP error` during backpropagation that is thrown when executing `bond_losses[atompair_mask].mean()`. I initially suspected (based on prior experience with e.g., AMD GPUs, namely the MI250x line) that this was caused by hardware/driver limitations for ROCm (n.b., issue reproduced with versions 5.7, 6.1, and 6.2), and adding the `if` clause below confirmed my suspicions since the issue during backpropagation has now disappeared as a result. I've made a pull request into [another GitHub repository](<URL> that makes use of this workaround for AMD GPUs.

```The code snippet defines a maximum number of elements (`MAX_ELEMENTS_FOR_BACKPROP`) for backpropagation and handles large input sizes by randomly selecting a subset of atom pair indices to compute losses, thus avoiding errors during backpropagation. If the number of true atom pairs exceeds this limit, it masks out a random selection of indices to stay within the limit. Finally, it calculates the mean loss using the masked bond losses.```

It's also worth noting that `2e8` isn't a precise threshold where this issue occurs. In practice, an `atompair_mask` of shape `[B, N, N]`, where `B=4` and `N≈8,600`, is in the range of tensor sizes where I started seeing this issue arise. To be on the safe side, I decided on setting `MAX_ELEMENTS_FOR_BACKPROP=int(2e8)` since this is close to setting the maximum size at `[4, 7000, 7000]`.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title says that on AMD GPUs with ROCm versions 5.7-6.2, there's a problem backpropagating a loss tensor with more than 2e8 elements. The user encountered a HIP error during backpropagation when using `bond_losses[atompair_mask].mean()`. They suspected hardware/driver limitations and confirmed it by adding an if-clause that worked around the issue.

In the body, they provided code showing how they sub-sampled data to avoid the error. They mentioned setting a MAX_ELEMENTS threshold because larger tensors caused HIP errors. The environment details show they're using PyTorch with ROCm 6.2 and AMD MI250X GPUs. They also linked to another repo where they applied a workaround.

Looking at the patches, Patch 1 modifies a kernel launch in CUDA/ROCm code. It adds conditional checks for workgroup size, adjusting blocks and processing remaining elements in a loop to prevent invalid configurations. This seems like a fix to handle large tensor sizes without causing HIP errors. Patch 2 adds a test case for large tensors on CUDA, ensuring the issue doesn't recur.

The label assigned is ""bug."" A bug typically refers to an unintended behavior or defect in the code. Here, the problem arises from how PyTorch handles large tensors on AMD GPUs, leading to HIP errors. The patches fix this by adjusting kernel launches and adding tests, which addresses the root cause.

So yes, the issue describes a bug where certain operations fail on specific hardware under given conditions, and the patches resolve it. Therefore, the label ""bug"" is accurate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it describes a defect in handling large tensors on AMD GPUs, which was fixed by code changes. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me read through the provided information carefully.

The issue's title mentions a problem with backpropagation on AMD GPUs when dealing with loss tensors exceeding a certain size (2e8 elements). The body provides more detail about an error during backpropagation, specifically a HIP error when executing a mean operation on bond losses. The user has implemented a workaround by subsetting the data to avoid this issue.

Looking at the code snippet provided, it shows that without the if-clause, the error occurs, but with it, the problem is resolved. This suggests that there's an unexpected behavior in PyTorch or ROCm when handling large tensors during backpropagation. The user also mentions that they've made a pull request to another repository to apply this workaround, indicating that others might encounter the same issue.

The versions listed include PyTorch 2.3.0a and ROCm 6.2, which are specific enough to identify potential compatibility issues or bugs in those libraries. The environment details, like the AMD EPYC processor and Instinct MI250X GPU, further narrow down the hardware context where this bug manifests.

The description points out that 2e8 isn't a precise threshold, implying variability but consistent enough occurrence under certain conditions. This behavior is unexpected for the user, as they've encountered it across multiple ROCm versions (5.7 to 6.2), which strengthens the case that it's a genuine bug rather than a configuration issue.

The label ""bug"" seems accurate because it describes an unintended functionality or error in the software stack (PyTorch or underlying ROCm drivers) when handling large tensors during backpropagation on AMD GPUs.

### What did you expect to see?

Can you please make the necessary updates to pickup the [patch](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the provided issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the patches, Patch 37 seems to involve some changes related to an SVG pan library. It's a go.mod file where one line is removed: github.com/google/pprof/third_party/d3flamegraph and another line is present: github.com/google/pprof/third_party/svgpan. Wait, no, looking again, actually in Patch 38, the line for d3flamegraph is commented out with a #, which means it's being excluded or removed from the dependencies.

Wait, in the go.mod file, lines starting with '#' are comments, not actual dependencies. So in the original version (Patch 37), there was an explicit comment line for github.com/ianlancetaylor/demangle, and another line for d3flamegraph which is commented out. Then in Patch 38, it seems that the d3flamegraph line is removed because it's now a comment, but wait no: looking at the context, in the go.mod file, lines are either modules or comments.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again:

In Patch 37, the go.mod includes:
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/d3flamegraph
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/svgpan

Then in Patch 38, the d3flamegraph line is commented out with a #, indicating it's no longer needed. So the change involves modifying the dependencies by removing one and keeping another.

Wait, but actually, looking at the go.mod content:

In the initial version (before), we have:
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/d3flamegraph
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/svgpan

Then in the updated version (after), the d3flamegraph line is commented out with a #, and the svgpan line remains.

Wait no, looking at the actual patches:

Patch 38 shows that the line for d3flamegraph is now preceded by a #, which means it's commented out. So in the go.mod file, it was previously uncommented (a dependency) and now it's commented (not a dependency anymore). The svgpan line remains as is.

So this indicates that the project is removing the d3flamegraph dependency and possibly upgrading or keeping the svgpan one.

The issue report's title isn't given, but based on the patches, it seems to be about updating dependencies. The label ""dependency upgrade"" suggests that they're updating versions of existing dependencies or adding new ones.

In this case, the project is removing d3flamegraph and perhaps upgrading svgpan, or just adjusting which dependencies are used. So the action involves modifying dependencies, specifically upgrading or changing them.

Therefore, the label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate because it's about managing the project's dependencies, whether by updating versions or replacing them.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the information given.

The title of the issue is ""cmd/vendor: update pprof"". That immediately tells me that the problem is related to updating a vendor dependency in the Go project, specifically pprof. So the main action here seems to be an update request.

Looking into the body, there are some details about the environment setup with Go version 1.22 and various other configurations from `go env`. But the meat of the issue comes next. The user explains that the maintainer of pprof patched a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to d3-color, as linked in their issue. However, despite this patch, the dependency on d3-flamegraph is still present in the latest version of Go.

The user then describes what they expected: an update to incorporate the necessary patch mentioned. So, the core issue here is that a vulnerability (CVE) was addressed upstream in pprof, but the Go project's vendor directory hasn't been updated to reflect this change, leaving it vulnerable or outdated.

Now, considering the label ""dependency upgrade"": this term typically refers to updating a dependency to a newer version to incorporate bug fixes, security patches, or new features. In this case, the issue is about updating pprof within Go's vendor directory to include a security patch that's already been applied upstream. This fits because it's asking for an update to the pprof library to ensure that the CVE fix is included in Go.

I don't see any mention of other types of issues like bugs or feature requests, so ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate here. There's no indication that this is a bug in Go itself or a new feature request; it's purely about updating an existing dependency.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to updating a dependency to incorporate security patches.

pytorch/pytorch,140001,feature request,Move the magma the Windows builds as well to pytorch/pytorch,cc @malfet @seemethere @peterjc123 @mszhanyi @skyline75489 @nbcsm @iremyux @Blackhex,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""feature request"" is accurate for this particular issue based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the patches: ""Build MAGMA for Windows."" That suggests that someone wants to add the capability to build MAGMA on Windows, which wasn't possible before. So that sounds like a new feature or functionality being added.

Next, I see that there are two patches provided. Patch 1 seems to be modifying some batch files related to CUDA installation and setting up the environment for building. It includes installing specific versions of CUDA, setting paths, and ensuring necessary tools are in place. This is all about enabling the build process on Windows, which again points towards adding a new feature.

Patch 4 introduces a GitHub Actions workflow specifically for building MAGMA on Windows. The workflow is set up to run on Windows Server 2019, with different CUDA versions and configurations (Release and Debug). It also includes steps to upload artifacts to S3, which implies that this setup is meant to integrate seamlessly into the existing CI/CD pipeline for PyTorch. This kind of automation for building MAGMA on Windows would be a significant addition, fitting the description of a feature request.

The body of the issue includes some YAML configurations for GitHub Actions and batch scripts, which are essential for setting up the build environment. These changes are not just minor bug fixes or documentation updates; they're about adding substantial functionality to support building MAGMA on Windows, which wasn't supported before.

Additionally, the label ""feature request"" is typically used when someone is asking for a new feature or enhancement. In this case, since the issue is about adding support for building MAGMA on Windows, it fits well under that category rather than being a bug fix or other types of issues.

So putting it all together: the changes are introducing new build capabilities, integrating with CI/CD pipelines, and setting up necessary environments—all of which are characteristic of a feature request. Therefore, the label seems accurate.
</think>

The patches introduce new functionality to support building MAGMA on Windows, including CI/CD integration. This is a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

1",0,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""feature request"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. So, the title of the issue is: ""Move the magma the Windows builds as well to pytorch/pytorch"". Hmm, that wording seems a bit off. Maybe it should be ""Move the magma to Windows builds as well..."" or something like that? I'm not entirely sure what they're asking for here.

Looking at the body, all it says is a list of people being cc'd. That doesn't give me much context about what the issue is actually about. So, from just the title, it seems like someone wants to move magma (maybe a project or part of the codebase) to Windows builds within the pytorch/pytorch repository.

Now, considering the label ""feature request,"" I know that usually feature requests are for new functionalities or enhancements. But this issue is about moving something to another place, which sounds more like a task or a change in process rather than a new feature. It could be related to internal project management or build configurations.

I'm leaning towards thinking that the label might not accurately reflect the issue because it doesn't seem to be requesting a new feature but rather adjusting where existing components are located. Without more context from the body, I can only go off the title, which points towards a move or reorganization rather than a feature addition.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33492,cache,`@Cacheable` throws `NullPointerException` when `RuntimeException` is thrown inside annotated code,"Hi, I have a piece of code in a reactive project that looks something like that (similar code for demo purposes):

```The code snippet defines a method `get` that returns a `Mono<String>` and caches the result in Redis with the key `CONSTANT`. The method always returns a `Mono` emitting the string ""result"" but throws an exception after success using `doOnSuccess`. The exception is thrown from a separate method `throwException`.```

I have a specific exception, but it basically extends from `RuntimeException`.

I've been debugging a little, and it seems that `CacheAspectSupport` had a piece of code added in commit 8974da2a that changed `ReactiveCachingHandler` from this:

```The code returns an adapter from a publisher that processes a cached future. If the future is empty, it falls back to a deferred Mono evaluated by `evaluate`. The result is then flattened using `flatMap` and re-evaluated if necessary.```

to this:

```The code returns an adapter from a publisher that handles a cached future, switches to a deferred mono if the future is empty, flattens the evaluated mono, and handles runtime exceptions by retrying evaluation or rethrowing the exception.```

The thing is, first evaluate call before the method execution sets the contexts.processed to true, and after my method throws the runtime exception, is caught by this `onErrorResume`, which calls evaluate with `cacheHit` set to `null`, and 

```This code snippet checks if the `processed` attribute of the `contexts` object is true. If it is, the function returns the value of `cacheHit`.```

returns `null`.

Is this an actual issue or I am missing something?

As of now I've done a couple of extra tests, and it seems that I cannot throw a `RuntimeException`. I have two CacheManagers configured in my Spring Boot project, one for Caffeine and the other one for Redis. This only happens when using the `RedisCacheManager` as seen above.

I think this might be because `CaffeineCache` implementation of `Cache` returns `null` when the element is not present whereas `RedisCache` implementation returns a cachedFuture.

Thanks in advance for any help provided!
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""`@Cacheable` throws `NullPointerException` when `RuntimeException` is thrown inside annotated code"". The issue is about a problem with the `@Cacheable` annotation causing an NPE under certain conditions. So this directly relates to caching functionality in Spring, as `@Cacheable` is part of the caching annotations.

Next, the body describes how the user encountered an issue when using RedisCacheManager and not Caffeine. They provided code snippets showing where the exception occurs and how it's handled, especially pointing out changes made in a specific commit. The problem arises during error handling within the caching mechanism, specifically with how `RuntimeException` is processed after a cache miss.

The patches that resolved this issue modify parts of the `findInCaches` method. They adjust how exceptions are handled by checking if an evaluated result is null and then returning an error. This seems to prevent the NPE by ensuring proper error propagation instead of potentially returning null and causing issues downstream.

Now, considering the label ""cache"". The entire issue revolves around caching behavior in Spring, specifically with `@Cacheable`, cache managers (Redis vs Caffeine), and how exceptions are handled during cache operations. The patches also directly modify code within the caching handler, which is part of the caching functionality.

I don't see any aspects of this issue that would fall outside of caching concerns. There's no mention of other Spring features like security, web, or database access. It's entirely about how exceptions are handled in a caching context, specifically with reactive types (Mono and Flux).

Additionally, the added test cases in Patch 2 further solidify that this is a cache-related issue because they test the error handling within cached services using `@Cacheable` methods.

So putting it all together, the label ""cache"" accurately captures the essence of the problem. It's about an exception occurring during caching operations and how the caching framework handles such exceptions.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""`@Cacheable` throws `NullPointerException` when `RuntimeException` is thrown inside annotated code."" The title mentions `@Cacheable`, which is related to caching in Spring. So that's a clue pointing towards cache-related issues.

Now, moving on to the body. The user provided some Java code using `Mono` from Reactor, which suggests it's a reactive application. They're using `@Cacheable` with RedisCacheManager and Caffeine. The problem arises when a RuntimeException is thrown in the annotated method, leading to a NullPointerException.

They discussed changes made in a specific commit (8974da2a) within CacheAspectSupport, modifying ReactiveCachingHandler. This involves handling of cached Futures and error handling with onErrorResume. They're seeing different behaviors between RedisCacheManager and CaffeineCacheManager, where the former returns a cachedFuture while the latter might return null.

The user is confused if this behavior is an actual issue or something they missed, suspecting it's related to how each CacheManager handles cache misses. The problem seems to revolve around caching mechanisms, specifically how exceptions are handled when using different cache managers in a reactive context.

So, considering all this, the core of the issue is about caching—specifically how @Cacheable interacts with different cache implementations (Redis vs. Caffeine) and how exceptions are managed in those contexts. The NullPointerException seems to stem from these interactions, making ""cache"" an appropriate label since it's directly related to caching mechanisms and their handling.

I don't see any mention of other aspects like performance, configuration, or other features that might suggest a different label. It's all about the behavior of the cache when exceptions occur in cached methods.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43563,configuration,KafkaProperties fail to build SSL properties when the bundle name is an empty string,Forward port of issue #43561 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""KafkaProperties fail to build SSL properties when the bundle name is an empty string."" This suggests that there's a bug in how KafkaProperties handles SSL configurations when the bundle name isn't provided or is set to an empty string.

The body mentions it's a forward port of issue #43561 to 3.4.x, so this is likely a bug fix being applied to a different branch.

Now, examining the patches:

Patch 1 modifies the KafkaProperties.java file. The main changes are:
- Added an import for StringUtils.
- Refactored the buildProperties method to handle empty bundle names by checking if getBundle() returns a non-null and non-empty string using StringUtils.hasText(bundleName). If it does, it calls buildPropertiesForSslBundle; otherwise, it proceeds with setting other properties related to keyStore, trustStore, etc.
- Created a helper method buildPropertiesForSslBundle that specifically handles the case when a bundle name is provided.
- Updated the validate() method by replacing throwIfMultipleNonNullValuesIn with throwIfMultipleMatchingValuesIn and using hasValue as the predicate. This changes how mutually exclusive configurations are checked.

Patch 2 and Patch 4 seem to just update copyright years, which isn't directly relevant but indicates version updates.

Patch 3 adds a new test case: sslPemConfigurationWithEmptyBundle(). It sets various SSL properties and an empty bundle string, then checks if the consumerProperties contain the expected entries. This test ensures that when the bundle is empty, the other configurations are still correctly applied.

Putting it all together, the issue revolves around how KafkaProperties configures SSL settings when certain parameters (like the bundle name) are empty. The patches adjust the code to properly handle this scenario without errors and add tests to validate this behavior.

The label ""configuration"" fits because the problem is about how configuration properties are handled, specifically SSL configurations in KafkaProperties. The changes ensure that the configuration behaves correctly even with an empty bundle name, which directly relates to configuration handling.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me look at the title and body of the issue first.

The title says: ""KafkaProperties fail to build SSL properties when the bundle name is an empty string."" So it's about KafkaProperties not working correctly when a certain condition (bundle name being empty) occurs, specifically related to building SSL properties. That seems to relate to how Kafka is configured, since SSL settings are part of configuring connections.

The body is just a forward port note from another issue, which probably means the same problem exists in different versions or branches. The original issue (#43561) was addressed and now it's being moved or fixed in 3.4.x. But the content itself isn't adding more context, so I can focus mainly on the title.

Now, considering the label ""configuration."" This usually refers to issues related to setting up or configuring parts of the system. Since the problem is about SSL properties not building correctly when a certain parameter (bundle name) is empty, it's about how KafkaProperties are configured. If the configuration expects a bundle name and doesn't handle an empty string well, that could cause these build failures.

So the issue seems to be directly related to configuration problems in KafkaProperties. Therefore, assigning the ""configuration"" label makes sense because it accurately reflects the nature of the problem described.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[Dynamo][TVM] TVM backend not work on macOS nor Linux aarch64"". The title indicates that there's an issue with the TVM backend in PyTorch's Dynamo on both macOS and Linux aarch64 systems. So, the problem is related to the backend not functioning correctly on these platforms.

Next, the body of the issue describes the bug where using torch.compile with the TVM backend fails. The error messages on macOS mention a missing /proc/cpuinfo file, which is a Linux-specific file. On Linux aarch64, there's an error about using LLVM with the wrong target CPU. 

The repro steps show that the problem arises when trying to compile a function with the TVM backend, leading to specific errors depending on the OS. This suggests that the issue is tied to how the TVM backend determines the appropriate compiler flags or targets based on the system architecture.

Now, looking at the patches applied: they modify the `llvm_target()` function. Before, it was checking /proc/cpuinfo for AVX features and returning specific CPU targets. The patch adds a check for the platform using sys.platform == ""linux"" before accessing /proc/cpuinfo. It also adjusts the logic to handle different CPU features. On non-Linux platforms like macOS, it returns a generic ""llvm"" target.

So, the patches are adjusting how the compiler target is determined based on the system's platform and CPU architecture. This involves modifying the backend's code to correctly identify and set the appropriate LLVM targets without relying on Linux-specific files when not applicable.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". The issue revolves around the TVM backend's interaction with the compiler, specifically how it determines the correct LLVM target for different platforms. The patches fix the compiler-related logic by making it platform-aware. Therefore, the problem and solution are indeed related to the compiler or backend compilation process.

I think the label ""compiler"" fits because the issue is about the backend (TVM) not correctly setting up the compiler (LLVM) targets on certain systems. The changes made in the patches are to ensure that the correct compiler flags and targets are used based on the system's architecture, which directly relates to compilation.
</think>

The label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the issue because it deals with how the TVM backend sets LLVM targets across different platforms.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title and body of the issue.

The title is ""[Dynamo][TVM] TVM backend not work on macOS nor Linux aarch64"". So it's about the TVM backend failing on two different systems: macOS and Linux aarch64.

Looking at the body, the user describes a bug where they can't use torch.compile with the TVM backend. The error messages are different for each OS. On macOS, there's a FileNotFoundError related to '/proc/cpuinfo', which is a system file that contains CPU information. On Linux aarch64, the error message talks about using an incorrect -mcpu flag when compiling with LLVM.

The repro steps show that when they try to compile a function with TVM, it fails on both systems for different reasons. The macOS issue seems related to the code expecting a file that doesn't exist on macOS (since /proc/cpuinfo is a Linux thing). The Linux aarch64 error mentions an invalid CPU target being used, suggesting that the compiler flags are incorrect.

So, the problem arises from how TVM or Dynamo is handling compilation for different architectures. On macOS, it's trying to access a file that isn't present, which could be a path issue or incorrect assumption about the system. On Linux aarch64, it's using an x86-specific CPU flag (core-avx2) which doesn't apply to ARM CPUs.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". Since both issues are related to how the code is being compiled—whether it's detecting the correct CPU info or using appropriate flags for different architectures—the problems stem from compiler-related logic in TVM or Dynamo. Therefore, the label seems accurate because it points to issues within the compilation process when using the TVM backend across these operating systems and architectures.
</think>

The issue revolves around compilation errors with TVM backend on specific OS/architecture combinations, indicating a problem with how the code is compiled. Thus, the ""compiler"" label fits.

php/php-src,15661,runtime error,Access null pointer in Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c,"### Description

The following code:

```This PHP code snippet includes a `require_once` statement to include and execute the contents of the file `phar_oo_test.inc`. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, it will result in a fatal error.```

Resulted in this output:
```The log indicates an undefined behavior sanitizer error occurring at line 5043 in the file `/php-src/Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c`. Specifically, it shows that a non-zero offset of 36 was applied to a null pointer, resulting in a runtime error.```

To reproduce:
```This code snippet sets configuration directives for PHP's OpCache extension in a command-line context. It enables OpCache and JIT compilation with specific settings.```


### PHP Version

PHP 8.4.0-dev

### Operating System

ubuntu 22.04",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Access null pointer in Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c"". This suggests there's a problem with accessing a null pointer, which usually points to a bug or crash happening during execution. Null pointer accesses often lead to runtime errors because they cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Next, the body of the issue includes an error message: ""runtime error: applying non-zero offset 36 to null pointer"" and mentions UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer detecting undefined behavior. This explicitly states that a runtime error occurred due to accessing memory improperly, which aligns with the label ""runtime error"".

The patches provided also support this. Patch 2 modifies code in zend_inference.c, specifically changing how the next opcode is handled by checking if ssa_op is not null before using it. This prevents a potential null pointer dereference, which would cause a runtime crash.

Patch 3 adds a test case that triggers the issue and expects to output ""Done"" without errors, indicating that after the fix, the code should run without crashing—further confirming it's a runtime error scenario.

The label assigned is ""runtime error"". Since all evidence points to an issue that causes the program to crash or behave incorrectly at runtime, this label accurately reflects the problem described.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the title and body of the issue carefully.

The title is ""Access null pointer in Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c"". That immediately tells me that there's an issue with a null pointer access in a specific C file related to the Zend Optimizer. Null pointer accesses typically cause crashes or unexpected behavior because the program is trying to access memory through a pointer that doesn't point to a valid location.

Looking at the body, the user provided some PHP code and the output it produced. The code is just including a Phar file, which probably triggers some optimization or inference in the Zend Optimizer. The output shows an error from the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, specifically mentioning an undefined behavior due to applying a non-zero offset to a null pointer at line 5043 of zend_inference.c.

The steps to reproduce involve enabling certain options related to opcache and JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation. PHP version is 8.4.0-dev, which is a development version, so it's expected that there might be bugs or issues still present.

Now, the label assigned is ""runtime error"". A runtime error refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, as opposed to compile-time errors. In this case, the issue is happening when running the PHP script, which triggers a problem in the Zend Optimizer component. The error message from UBSan indicates undefined behavior because of accessing memory incorrectly, which fits the category of runtime errors.

I should consider whether ""runtime error"" captures the essence of the problem described. Since the issue occurs during execution and results in a crash or undefined behavior, it's appropriate to label it as such. There might be more specific labels like ""crash"" or ""memory error,"" but ""runtime error"" is sufficiently accurate.

I don't see any information that would suggest this isn't a runtime error. The presence of the UBSan report further solidifies that it's a runtime issue because sanitizers typically check for such errors during execution.

Therefore, I conclude that the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the problem described in the issue report.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" correctly identifies the issue as it pertains to an error occurring during program execution.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""search"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Workbench search does not use correct findMatch foreground colors."" This clearly mentions an issue related to searching in the workbench. The problem is about the color settings for search matches not being applied correctly.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It's categorized as a bug and provides steps to reproduce, which involve using the workbench sidebar search. The actual behavior shows that the text color isn't what's expected, while the expected behavior aligns with custom configurations. This further ties the issue to how search results are displayed.

The patches provided modify classes related to search matches by adding inline class names. These changes are directly aimed at fixing how search results are styled, which is part of the search functionality in VS Code.

Considering all these points—title mentions search, body describes a bug in search behavior, and patches target search result styling—it's clear that the issue revolves around the search feature. Therefore, the label ""search"" is appropriate and accurately reflects the problem described.
</think>

The label ""search"" correctly categorizes the issue as it pertains to problems with the workbench's search functionality, specifically how it displays text colors when matches are found.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""search"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title: ""Workbench search does not use correct findMatch foreground colors."" The title mentions ""workbench search,"" which immediately tells me that the issue has something to do with searching within VS Code's workbench.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. It's categorized as a bug, and the user provided steps to reproduce it. They added custom colors to their configuration for findMatch highlights. Then, they used the sidebar search, not the search widget, which is an important distinction because different search functionalities might behave differently.

The actual behavior observed is that the match text color is default blue, but they expected it to be black as per their custom settings. They even provided images, which helps visualize the problem.

Looking at the version information and system details, it's a Linux setup with VS Code 1.96.2. The extensions listed don't immediately seem relevant unless one of them interferes with search functionality or color themes, but that's speculative.

The key points here are:
- The issue is about the workbench search not using the correct colors as configured.
- The steps to reproduce involve changing color settings and performing a search via the sidebar.

So, the problem revolves around how the search function in the workbench isn't applying the user's custom color settings. The label ""search"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to the search functionality within VS Code's interface.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but if I were to consider others, maybe something like ""theming"" or ""configuration"" could also apply since it's about colors and settings not being applied. However, ""search"" is a more precise label because the issue specifically affects how search results are displayed in terms of text color.

Therefore, the label ""search"" accurately reflects the content of this issue report.
</think>

The label ""search"" accurately captures the essence of the issue, which pertains to the workbench search functionality not applying custom colors correctly.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""crypto/aes:gofips140: unrecognized failures [consistent failure]"". It mentions a consistent failure in the crypto/aes package related to gofips140. The word ""panic"" isn't in the title, but the issue is about some kind of failure.

Now, the body of the issue includes a panic message: ""panic: fips140: cannot verify in asan mode"". There's also a stack trace showing that the panic occurred during initialization of the check package. So clearly, a panic happened here because of an issue with FIPS verification when ASAN (AddressSanitizer) is enabled.

The patches provided are three in number. Patch 1 modifies how fipsSupported is checked by adding a condition to return false if asan is enabled. It seems they're disabling FIPS support when ASAN is on to prevent the panic. Patch 2 adds a comment about re-enabling tests elsewhere once FIPS and ASAN work together, indicating that currently they don't. Patch 3 skips a test when ASAN is enabled because it causes panics.

So all these patches are addressing the fact that running with ASAN causes a panic related to FIPS verification. The label ""panic"" was assigned, which directly relates to the error message and the root cause of the issue. The problem was that under certain conditions (ASAN enabled), the code would panic due to an incompatibility.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue because the core problem is a panic occurring during FIPS verification when ASAN is active.
</think>

The label ""panic"" correctly represents the issue as it directly addresses the panic caused by FIPS verification under ASAN. 

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""crypto/aes:gofips140: unrecognized failures [consistent failure]"". It mentions an unrecognized failure in the crypto/aes package related to gofips140. The term ""panic"" isn't explicitly in the title, but it suggests some kind of error or crash occurring.

Now, examining the body of the issue report. There's a code block starting with #!watchflakes, which indicates this is part of Go's watchflakes system for tracking test flakes. The default line shows a panic message: ""panic: fips140: cannot verify in asan mode"". This clearly states that a panic occurred.

Further down, there's an example log provided. It starts with the same panic message, followed by a stack trace showing where the panic was triggered. The stack trace points to runtime/panic.go and crypto/internal/fips140/check/check.go, which confirms that the program panicked during execution.

The issue is created automatically to collect these specific failures, and the watchflakes link suggests it's tracking this particular error as a flaky test or consistent failure.

So, putting it all together: both the title implies an error causing a test failure, and the body explicitly shows a panic with a stack trace. The assigned label ""panic"" directly refers to the occurrence of a panic in the code, which is clearly documented here.
</think>

The issue report explicitly mentions a panic with a detailed stack trace, so the label accurately reflects this.

Okay, so I'm looking at this issue where someone is trying to determine if a label assigned to an issue report in a code repository accurately reflects the content of that report. The label given is ""compiler"", and they're asking whether it's appropriate based on the provided title, body, and patches.

First, I need to understand what each part of the issue says. The issue starts with several error messages related to Rust compiler issues. These errors mention problems like lifetimes not living long enough, implementations not being general enough, and mismatched types. The patches seem to address these by adjusting how certain traits are implemented or used.

Looking at the title of the issue report isn't provided directly, but based on the context, it's probably something about Rust compiler errors related to lifetimes or trait implementations. The body includes detailed error messages from the Rust compiler, which suggests that this is a problem with how the code is being compiled or checked by the Rust compiler.

The patches made to the repository are in response to these errors. For example, one patch changes a method signature to include a specific trait bound, which helps the compiler understand that a type meets all necessary constraints across different lifetimes. Another patch adjusts the way a closure is passed to a function, ensuring it matches the expected type and lifetime requirements.

Since all these changes are directly related to how the Rust compiler interprets and checks the code, the label ""compiler"" seems appropriate. The issue revolves around errors emitted by the compiler and the fixes needed to resolve them, which falls under compiler-related issues rather than, say, runtime errors or library functionality.

I should also consider if there's any other possible label that might fit better, but given the context, ""compiler"" is spot on because it's all about the compilation process and ensuring the code meets the language's requirements.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""regression: trait bound not satisfied."" This suggests that there's a regression, which means something that worked before is now broken. The term ""trait bound not satisfied"" refers to Rust's type system, where traits define shared behavior. If a trait bound isn't satisfied, it usually indicates a problem with how the compiler handles these types or trait implementations.

Now, examining the body of the issue. It contains multiple links to logs from different sources, which likely point to specific errors encountered by users when compiling their code. Then there's an error message:

error[E0277]: the trait bound `for<'a> beef::generic::Cow<'a, str, beef::wide::internal::Wide>: Borrow<beef::generic::Cow<'_, str, lean::internal::Lean>>` is not satisfied

This is a Rust compiler error. The E0277 code refers to a failed trait implementation, meaning the compiler can't find the necessary trait for a type. The error message points out that a certain Cow type doesn't implement Borrow for another Cow type with different internals.

The line in page.rs:433 indicates where the issue occurs in the user's code. The mention of ""likely #119820"" suggests it's related to an existing issue, and the note says this was intended breakage, so it might be a known regression introduced in a recent compiler version.

Given all this, the problem is directly tied to how the Rust compiler handles trait bounds and type conversions. It's not about runtime behavior or library functionality but about the compiler correctly applying the rules of the language. Therefore, the label ""compiler"" is appropriate because it accurately reflects that the issue pertains to the compiler's handling of traits and type systems.

So yes, the label ""compiler"" fits this report.
</think>

The issue revolves around a Rust compiler error related to trait bounds not being satisfied, which directly involves the compiler's ability to handle types correctly.

golang/go,65237,enhancement,spec: document range-over-func,Tracking bug for adding range-over-func to spec. See #61405.,1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the issue title: ""spec: document range-over-func"". This suggests that the issue is about documenting a new feature or functionality in the specification. The term ""document"" implies adding or clarifying something in the official specs, which usually falls under documentation rather than a bug fix or enhancement.

The body of the issue is a tracking bug for adding range-over-func to the spec and references another issue #61405. Tracking bugs are often used to monitor the progress of specific features or tasks. This further indicates that it's about implementing or documenting something new, which would typically be an enhancement if it's a feature addition.

Now, examining the patches provided:

Patch 1 updates the subtitle of the specification document from go1.22 to go1.23. This seems like a version update, likely related to the release notes or documentation for a new Go version, which could be part of an enhancement release.

Patch 2 modifies the grammar section in the spec, adding details about functions as range expressions. It explains how the iteration works when using a function with yield, providing examples and usage cases. This is clearly documenting a new feature or functionality related to range-over-func.

The added content includes new cases for functions in the range expression table and detailed explanations of how the loop interacts with the yield function. These changes are about expanding the documentation to include this new feature, which suggests it's an enhancement to the language specification.

Enhancement labels are typically used for issues that propose new features or improvements to the existing codebase. Since the patches add documentation for a new range-over-func feature, this fits the definition of an enhancement.

Therefore, the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate because the issue tracks adding and documenting a new feature in the Go language specification.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

The title of the issue is ""spec: document range-over-func"". The word ""spec"" here probably refers to specifications or documentation. So, it seems like they're talking about documenting something called ""range-over-func"".

Looking at the body, it says, ""Tracking bug for adding range-over-func to spec. See #61405."" A tracking bug usually means that this issue is keeping track of another task or bug, which in this case is adding a feature or functionality to the specifications.

Now, considering the label ""enhancement"". Typically, enhancements are about new features or improvements to existing ones. Since this issue is about documenting something (which might be a new feature) and tracking its addition, it sounds like they're enhancing the documentation or the spec.

So yes, ""enhancement"" makes sense here because they're adding or improving something in the specifications.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as an enhancement to the documentation/specifications.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Add support for Kotlin duration format (composite style)"". The word ""add"" suggests that they're introducing a new feature or functionality. That makes me think about whether this is an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

Next, I'll look into the patches provided to see what changes were made. There are four patches here. 

Patch 1 modifies DurationFormatterUtils.java by adding support for composite style parsing and printing. It includes handling of various units like days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. This indicates that they're expanding the capabilities of the existing code to handle a new format.

Patch 2 adds unit tests in DurationFormatterTests.kt. These tests check if the parser correctly interprets composite durations, handles positive and negative signs, spaces, partial durations, and edge cases like bad signs or units. Adding tests usually accompanies new features to ensure they work as intended.

Patch 3 updates another test file, adding more test cases for parsing and detecting composite styles. It also includes checks for compatibility with Kotlin's duration formatting, which suggests that this is about integrating with a new feature or improving interoperability.

Patch 4 introduces a new test class, DurationFormatterUtilsKotlinTests.kt, specifically targeting the compatibility of the formatter with Kotlin durations. This includes testing how the formatter handles strings produced by Kotlin's duration toString() method and ensuring proper parsing or failure when necessary.

Now, considering the nature of these changes: they're not fixing broken functionality but rather adding new capabilities to support a different format (Kotlin's composite style). This aligns with what an enhancement typically entails—expanding features or improving functionality without necessarily repairing bugs.

The issue report includes both feature additions and test cases to validate those additions. The fact that it's about compatibility with another language's (Kotlin) duration formatting further points towards this being an enhancement rather than a bug fix or maintenance task.

So, putting it all together: the changes are additive, introducing new supported formats and ensuring they work correctly. This is characteristic of an enhancement, which aims to improve or extend existing functionality.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's read through the title: ""Support flexible multi-unit duration format in @DurationFormat"". The word ""support"" here suggests that they're looking to add a new feature or improve an existing one. That makes me think of enhancements rather than bug fixes.

Now, looking at the body. It mentions that issue #30396 introduced support for multiple styles of parsing/printing Durations, including a new SIMPLE format inspired by Spring Boot. Then it discusses adding support for a multi-components format like ""1h 30m 13s"", similar to what Kotlin does. Currently, Spring doesn't support this and requires using the ""PT1H30M13S"" format.

So they're proposing adding a new feature or improving an existing one by supporting another duration format. This isn't about fixing a bug but rather expanding functionality, which fits the definition of an enhancement.

I don't see any indication that this is a bug report; it's more about adding a feature. Therefore, the label ""enhancement"" seems appropriate here.
</think>

The issue proposes adding support for a new duration format, which is a feature request. The label accurately reflects this as an enhancement.

Alright, I'm trying to determine if the label ""testing"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""DISABLED test_pytree (__main__.TestFX)"". It clearly mentions a disabled test named test_pytree in TestFX. So the issue is about a test being turned off, which relates to testing infrastructure.

Next, the body explains that the test was disabled because it's failing in CI. They provided links to logs and mentioned it's been flaky with 14 failures and successes over time. They also included debugging instructions for investigating further. This context suggests that the problem is specifically related to the test suite and its reliability, which falls under testing.

Looking at the patches provided, they show lines being removed from a list of tests. Specifically, ""TestFX.test_pytree"" was removed. That means the fix involved disabling this failing test in the codebase, which again points to it being a testing-related issue.

The label assigned is ""testing"". Considering all these aspects—the title mentioning a disabled test, the body discussing CI failures and flakiness, and the patch removing the problematic test—it makes sense that the issue is about testing. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out if the label ""testing"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. So, first, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""DISABLED test_pytree (__main__.TestFX)"". That clearly mentions a disabled test, which relates to testing.

Now, looking at the body, it explains that the test was disabled because it's failing in CI. They provided links to logs and mentioned that the test is flaky, with multiple failures and successes. The debugging instructions are about checking workflow logs and grepping for specific terms related to the test. There's also a mention of the test file path and several people being CC'd, which might be maintainers or relevant team members.

The entire content revolves around a test case that isn't working correctly in their CI/CD pipeline. The discussion is about why it was disabled, how it's behaving flakily, and steps to debug it. All of this is directly related to testing within the project—specifically, maintaining and troubleshooting tests.

So, considering all these points, the label ""testing"" seems spot on because the issue is about a problematic test case in their test suite. It doesn't seem to be about a bug in the codebase or a feature request; it's squarely focused on testing infrastructure and reliability.

### What did you expect to see?

print set GOAMD64=v3",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""cmd/go: not print not-defaults arch-env"". This suggests that there's an issue with how environment variables related to architecture are being handled by the Go command. The user is reporting that when they set GOAMD64=v3 and run the make script followed by 'go env -changed', the expected output doesn't include the setting of GOAMD64.

In the body, the user provided steps to reproduce: setting GOAMD64, running the make script, then checking the changed environment variables. They expected to see the GOAMD64 variable printed but didn't. This indicates that the 'go env -changed' command isn't showing the environment variable as it should when it's set to a non-default value.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 changes the variable names in buildcfg from lowercase (like defaultGOAMD64) to PascalCase (DefaultGOAMD64). This is a code style change but could affect how variables are referenced elsewhere.

Patch 2 modifies several environment variable assignments, replacing the use of buildcfg's fields with the new Default variables. For example, GOAMD64 now uses buildcfg.DefaultGOAMD64 instead of directly accessing buildcfg.GOAMD64. This suggests that the issue might be related to how default values are being set and compared against.

Patch 3 adds a test case where setting GOAMD64=v3 should result in 'GOAMD64=''v3'''. The expected output after running 'go env -changed' is that it prints the updated value of GOAMD64, which wasn't happening before. This patch seems to ensure that when a variable is set non-default, it's correctly reflected.

Patch 4 changes several functions (like goamd64(), goarm(), etc.) to use the new Default variables instead of the old default ones. For example, in goamd64(), it now uses envOr(""GOAMD64"", DefaultGOAMD64) instead of defaultGOAMD64. This adjustment likely ensures that when environment variables are checked against their defaults, they're using the correct values.

Putting this together, the issue was that 'go env -changed' wasn't displaying GOAMD64 when set to a non-default value because the code wasn't correctly checking against the right default variables. The patches fix this by updating variable references and ensuring proper comparisons. This is a bug because it's a malfunction in how environment variables are handled, leading to incorrect behavior.

So, yes, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue since it involves a defect in the code that was resolved with these changes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" correctly identifies an issue where the Go command didn't display non-default architecture environment variables. The patches fix how default values are handled and displayed.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided title and body.

First, let me read through the information given. The title of the issue is ""cmd/go: not print not-defaults arch-env"". That sounds like it's related to the Go command-line tool (cmd/go) not printing certain environment variables that aren't set to their default values, specifically architecture-related ones.

Looking at the body, the user provided details about their Go version, which is a development build from May 2024. They mentioned they didn't need to include the output of `go env`. 

In the steps they took: they set GOAMD64=v3 and ran make.bat, then executed `..\bin\go env -changed`. What they saw was that it didn't print the setting of GOAMD64=v3, which they expected it would.

So, the issue seems to be about a specific command (`go env -changed`) not outputting an environment variable (GOAMD64) when it's set. The user expects this variable to be printed because it's non-default, but it isn't happening.

Now, considering what defines a bug. A bug is typically an unintended behavior in the software that causes it to function incorrectly or not as expected. In this case, if `go env -changed` is supposed to list all environment variables that are not default and it fails to include GOAMD64 when set, then that's a deviation from expected functionality.

The user provided clear steps to reproduce and described both what happened and what they expected. This structure is typical for reporting bugs because it points out specific behavior that doesn't align with expectations, likely indicating an issue in the code.

I don't see any indication that this is a feature request or something else. The focus is on unexpected behavior when using a particular command, which fits the definition of a bug.

Then the notebook is **visible**
And it is called ""Flawed notebook"".",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. So first, I'll look at the issue report itself.

The title says that a shared notebook gets deleted if a contributor changes its title. That sounds like unexpected behavior—when you change the name of something you shouldn't lose data or functionality. 

Looking at the body, there's a detailed scenario. Alice creates and shares a notebook with Bob. When Bob accepts it and renames it, the share button disappears for him. Then, when Alice logs back in, the notebook is gone, all notes are deleted. Also, Bob can't reshare it because of an error. That definitely seems like incorrect behavior.

Now, the expected behavior is that renaming should update the title without removing the notebook or affecting sharing. So the problem here is that the system isn’t handling the rename correctly, leading to data loss and errors. This points to a bug because it's not functioning as intended.

Next, I'll look at the patch provided. It removes two lines where `is_shared` was set to 0 and `share_id` was set to an empty string in some folder entity creation. So previously, when a folder (notebook) was being created or updated, these fields were being reset, which might have caused the share to be removed upon renaming. The patch stops that from happening, which would fix the bug.

So putting it all together: the issue describes unexpected behavior leading to data loss and errors upon renaming a shared notebook, which is clearly a bug. The patch addresses this by correcting how shared properties are handled when updating the folder. Therefore, labeling this as ""bug"" is accurate.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because it describes unintended behavior causing data loss and functionality issues, which was fixed by adjusting how shared notebook properties were managed.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the title and body of the report carefully.

The title says, ""Shared notebook gets deleted if contributor changes its title."" That sounds like a problem because changing a title shouldn't delete anything. It suggests an unintended behavior.

Looking at the body, the user describes a scenario where Alice creates a notebook, shares it with Bob, and then Bob renames it. After that, the share button disappears for Bob, and when Alice logs back in, the notebook is gone along with all its notes. Additionally, Bob can't reshare it because of an error message.

So, breaking this down: When a shared notebook is renamed by a contributor (Bob), it leads to the notebook being deleted from Alice's account. That's definitely not the expected behavior. The user also outlines what should happen instead—renaming shouldn't cause deletion or sharing issues.

This situation indicates a malfunction in how the system handles shared notebooks when their titles are changed. It's causing data loss and unexpected errors, which are clear signs of a bug rather than a feature request or something else. There's no mention of requesting new functionality; it's about fixing an issue that's breaking current features.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it describes unintended behavior leading to data loss.

v8.4.0 master
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The issue title is ""show placement always pending."" That suggests that when someone runs a ""show placement"" command, it's stuck in a pending state instead of moving forward as expected. The body of the issue includes some steps to reproduce: creating a partitioned table with a specific placement and then running the show command. 

The user expected to see ""SCHEDULED,"" which implies that they thought the system would have moved past the initial pending phase. Instead, they saw an error message indicating it was still waiting for the schedule state, with the state being ""PENDING."" They also provided their TiDB version as v8.4.0 master.

Looking at the patches, there are three changes. The first patch adds a function to set a PD HTTP client for testing, which seems related to mocking or testing the behavior of the placement scheduling. The second patch includes adding a dependency on a mock library, which is often used in unit tests to simulate external dependencies. 

The third and largest patch modifies a test file by introducing several new test cases. It creates mock implementations of PD client methods to simulate different states (PENDING, INPROGRESS, REPLICATED) and checks how the system responds when these states are set. The tests seem to ensure that ""show placement"" accurately reflects the current state of regions, whether it's for a normal table or a partitioned one.

Putting this together, the issue seems to be about incorrect behavior where the placement status doesn't transition as expected. The patches add comprehensive testing to verify these states, which suggests that previously, there might have been a bug causing ""show placement"" to incorrectly display ""PENDING."" 

So, the label ""bug"" makes sense because it's an unintended behavior that needed fixing. The patches address this by improving how the system checks and reports the actual state of placements, ensuring that ""SCHEDULED"" is shown when appropriate.
</think>

The issue describes a bug where the placement status wasn't updating correctly. Patches were made to fix this by adding tests that verify correct state transitions.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me read through everything carefully.

The title of the issue is ""show placement always pending."" That makes it sound like there's an issue where something isn't working as expected, specifically related to show placement being stuck in a pending state.

Looking at the body, it's structured as a bug report with steps to reproduce. The user provided minimal reproduce steps: creating a partitioned table with placement and then showing the placement. They expected to see ""SCHEDULED"" but instead saw a log indicating the state is still PENDING. They also mentioned their TiDB version is v8.4.0 master.

So, this seems like an unexpected behavior where the system isn't transitioning from pending to scheduled as it should. That fits the definition of a bug because it's a deviation from expected functionality. The user is reporting an issue they encountered while using the software, which aligns with what a ""bug"" label typically represents on GitHub.

I don't see any indications that this is a feature request or something else. It's clearly about unexpected behavior in the current code. Therefore, the ""bug"" label seems accurate here.
</think>

The issue describes unexpected behavior where the placement state remains pending instead of becoming scheduled, which fits the definition of a bug.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33609,bug,Potential NPE from `MethodParameter.getMethod()` check in `KotlinDelegate.hasDefaultValue()`,"## Summary
In your repository (MAVENorg.springframework:spring-web @ 6.1.12), we have found a bug that may require your attention. 

In file: AbstractNamedValueArgumentResolver.java, class: KotlinDelegate, method: hasDefaultValue, there is a potential Null pointer dereference at:  <URL>

In other places of the code (e.g., <URL> or   <URL> the return value of the ```The code snippet provided is simply `getMethod`, which appears to be a method call but lacks context such as the method signature or class name.``` method was checked for null value. But if we put it directly inside ```The code snippet is using `Objects.requireNonNull`, which is a method to throw a `NullPointerException` if the provided object reference is `null`.```, we may have an exception.

A potential fix will be to replace the following line

```This code snippet retrieves a `Method` object from a given `parameter` and ensures it is not null using `Objects.requireNonNull`. If the `method` is null, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.```

with

```This code snippet retrieves a method from a `parameter` object and checks if it is null, returning false if it is.```

Another option could be to use ```The code snippet refers to the use of `Objects.requireNonNullElse`, which is a method from the Java Util.concurrent package that returns the first non-null argument, or the second argument if the first one is null.```.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

First, looking at the title: ""Potential NPE from `MethodParameter.getMethod()` check in `KotlinDelegate.hasDefaultValue()`"". That sounds like a bug because it's pointing out a possible null pointer exception, which is a type of runtime error. So, that aligns with a bug label.

Next, the body describes a potential issue where using Objects.requireNonNull without checking for null could cause an NPE. They provided examples from other parts of the code where they do check for null before using the method, suggesting that this is a missed case and thus a bug. The suggested fix replaces the requireNonNull with a manual null check, which makes sense to prevent the exception.

Looking at the patches, both Patch 1 and Patch 2 show changes in the KotlinDelegate class. They removed the import of Objects and replaced the line where method was assigned using requireNonNull. Instead, they now get the method and check if it's null, returning false if so. This change directly addresses the potential NPE by adding a proper null check.

The issue report also mentions that this was found using an intelligent code repair tool and manual triage, which adds credibility to it being a genuine bug rather than something else like a feature request or enhancement.

So putting it all together: the title points out a potential crash (NPE), the body explains why it's a problem with code examples, and the patches fix it by adding null checks. All of these elements clearly indicate that this is a bug report. Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Potential NPE from `MethodParameter.getMethod()` check in `KotlinDelegate.hasDefaultValue()`"". That clearly suggests there's a potential Null Pointer Exception (NPE) bug. The mention of a specific method and class indicates it's pointing to a particular part of the code where something might be going wrong.

Now, moving on to the body. It starts with a summary stating that a bug has been found in the repository, specifically referencing a file and line number where there's a potential null pointer dereference. The issue is about using `Objects.requireNonNull(parameter.getMethod())` without checking if it's null first, which could cause an NPE.

The reporter goes on to explain that in other parts of the code, they do check for null after calling `getMethod()`, but here it's being passed directly into `Objects.requireNonNull()`. They suggest a fix by replacing that line with a manual null check and returning false if it's null. Alternatively, using `Objects.requireNonNullElse` is another option.

They also mention that this was found using an intelligent code repair tool followed by manual triage, which adds credibility to the report as it’s systematic rather than just a random observation.

Considering all these points, the issue is definitely reporting a bug because it's pointing out a potential crash (NPE) and providing specific lines of code along with suggested fixes. The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this situation.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it reports a potential NPE with specific code references and suggests fixes.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43018,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.2.0,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.2.0"". That immediately tells me that this issue is about upgrading a dependency, specifically Spring Batch, from some version to 5.2.0. So the title suggests it's an upgrade of a library or dependency used in the project.

Next, the body is empty. There's no additional information provided beyond the title. Since the body doesn't add any context, I have to rely on the title and patches for my assessment.

Now, looking at the patch provided:

In Patch 1, there's a change from version ""5.2.0-SNAPSHOT"" to ""5.2.0"". This indicates that the dependency was previously using a snapshot version (which is typically unstable or in development) and is now being upgraded to a stable release version of Spring Batch.

So, putting this together: The issue's title clearly states an upgrade, and the patch confirms that by changing the dependency version from a snapshot to a final release. Therefore, the action taken was indeed an upgrade of a dependency.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"", which seems to fit perfectly because the changes involve updating a library to a newer version. There's no indication that this issue involved anything else like a bug fix or new feature; it's solely about updating the version of Spring Batch used in the project.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" is appropriate for a GitHub issue with the title ""Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.2.0"" and an empty body. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the title clearly mentions upgrading to a specific version of Spring Batch, which is a framework used in software development. Upgrading dependencies is a common task in software projects where you update libraries or frameworks to newer versions for various reasons like bug fixes, new features, or security patches.

The label ""dependency upgrade"" seems relevant because it directly relates to the action of updating a dependency. Even though the body of the issue is empty, the title gives enough context. Typically, issues with such titles are about planning or tracking the process of upgrading dependencies.

I don't see any information that would suggest this isn't about a dependency upgrade. The title doesn't hint at a bug fix, feature request, or other types of issues. It's straightforwardly about moving to version 5.2.0 of Spring Batch, which is a dependency in the project.

So, considering all this, the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the content of the issue report.
</think>

The title clearly indicates an action to update a specific dependency (Spring Batch) to version 5.2.0. The label ""dependency upgrade"" precisely captures this intent, even with an empty body.

I expected ./trace/gen.bash to copy the execution trace parser from GOROOT (which it did), to apply the code rewrites necessary to use it in its new location (did not) and without deleting the hand-maintained files in the ./trace directory (did not).

This relates to the meaning of sed's ""-i"" flag being different on GNU vs BSD.

I'll prepare a patch to make it work on both. That probably means using a non-empty backup suffix and subsequently deleting those copies. Does that sound like a good plan, @mknyszek @cagedmantis ?
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""shell"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is: ""x/exp/trace: gen.bash depends on GNU's sed, fails with BSD's"". That immediately tells me that there's a problem with the gen.bash script in the x/exp repository. The script relies on GNU sed, which works differently from BSD sed, causing it to fail on macOS, since macOS uses BSD utilities.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user explains that when they run the gen.bash script on macOS, it fails because of a sed command error. They provided the output showing an invalid command code '.' in sed, which is a common issue when GNU-specific features are used on BSD systems without proper handling.

The problem arises from the fact that the -i flag for sed behaves differently between GNU and BSD versions. In GNU sed, you can use -i with a backup suffix like -i'.tmp', but in BSD, if you want to make a backup, you have to provide a non-empty argument after -i, otherwise it's treated as an invalid command.

The patches provided show that the solution was to modify the sed commands. Instead of using -i alone, they added a '.tmp' suffix, which is compatible with both GNU and BSD. After making these changes, they also added a step to delete the temporary backup files created by sed.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""shell"". The issue revolves around shell scripting (gen.bash) and differences in command-line utilities (sed) across different systems. Shell scripts often rely on command-line tools, so issues like this are common when ensuring cross-compatibility between Linux (which usually uses GNU tools) and macOS (BSD tools).

The patches involve changing how sed is used in the shell script to make it compatible with both GNU and BSD versions. This directly relates to shell scripting best practices and dealing with portability issues.

Therefore, the label ""shell"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue because it's about a problem in a shell script caused by using system utilities (sed) that have differing behaviors across platforms.
</think>

The label ""shell"" is appropriate as the issue concerns a problem within a shell script due to differences in sed behavior between GNU and BSD systems, which are key components of shell scripting environments.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""shell"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's read through the title: ""x/exp/trace: gen.bash depends on GNU's sed, fails with BSD's"". The title indicates that there's an issue with a bash script (gen.bash) in the x/exp repository. Specifically, it's failing because it relies on GNU sed, which doesn't work correctly with BSD sed.

Now looking at the body of the issue. The user provides detailed information about their Go environment and the commands they ran. They mention that when executing gen.bash, there was an error with sed: ""sed: 1: ""./cmd/gotraceraw/main.go"": invalid command code ."". This suggests that the problem arises from using a GNU-specific sed feature (like the ""-i"" flag) which behaves differently on BSD systems, such as macOS.

The user's analysis points out that the issue stems from the difference in how GNU and BSD versions of sed handle certain flags. They propose a solution involving modifying how sed is used to be compatible with both systems, possibly by using a non-empty backup suffix and deleting those backups afterward.

So the core of the problem revolves around shell scripting, specifically around the use of sed in a bash script and ensuring cross-compatibility between different Unix-like systems (GNU vs BSD). The issue isn't about Go itself failing or a bug in the code but rather about the shell script's portability across different operating systems that use varying versions of command-line tools.

The label assigned is ""shell"". Considering all this, the issue is indeed related to shell scripting. It involves bash scripts and system commands (sed) which are integral parts of shell environments. Therefore, labeling it as ""shell"" accurately reflects the problem's nature.

denoland/deno,24858,package management,npm:log4js don't work,"Version: Deno 1.45.5
app.mjs

```This code snippet imports the `log4js` library, sets up a logger, configures its logging level to `info`, and logs messages of different severities from `debug` to `fatal`.```
output
![image](<URL>



",0,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""package management"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the details provided.

The issue title is ""npm:log4js don't work."" The body describes a problem where using log4js in Deno 1.45.5 isn't functioning as expected, providing some sample code and an output image (though I can't see the image). The key here is that the user is having trouble with the log4js package not working within their Deno setup.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. There are three patches:

1. Patch 1 modifies a TypeScript file related to cluster.ts, adding imports and changing several function implementations. It seems to be about setting up worker processes correctly.
2. Patch 2 adds a test case for cluster_test in the unit_test_factory.
3. Patch 3 introduces a new test file that checks various aspects of the node:cluster module's functionality.

These patches are primarily focused on implementing or correcting the behavior of Node.js cluster module functionalities in Deno. They're not directly about npm package management but rather about how Deno handles certain Node.js features, specifically related to clustering and worker processes.

The issue at hand is that log4js isn't working. Log4js is a logging library, so its malfunction could be due to various reasons, such as missing dependencies, incorrect imports, or issues with the environment setup in Deno. However, the patches provided don't seem to address the log4js package itself but rather the underlying cluster module implementation.

The label ""package management"" suggests that the issue is related to how packages are managed, installed, or resolved in npm. But in this case, the problem seems more about the functionality of a specific Node.js feature (cluster) within Deno and how it's being implemented or tested, not about managing packages per se.

So, putting it all together, the patches don't address package management issues but rather correct the behavior of the cluster module. Therefore, the label ""package management"" doesn't accurately reflect the nature of this issue.
</think>

The label ""package management"" does not accurately reflect the issue because the problem and its resolution pertain to implementing Node.js cluster functionality in Deno, not managing npm packages.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""package management"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at the title and body of the report.

The title says ""npm:log4js don't work"". That makes me think the user is having trouble with the log4js package from npm. The body includes a code snippet where they're importing log4js in Deno, setting up a logger, and trying to log messages at different levels. They also mention an output which seems to be an image link, but since I can't view it, I'll focus on the text.

So, what's the issue here? The user is using Deno (version 1.45.5) and trying to import log4js. From what I know, Deno has its own module system and might not support all npm packages out of the box because it uses ES modules and has security features like permission checks.

The problem seems to be that when they run their code, nothing happens. The logs aren't appearing as expected. They don't get any debug, info, warn, error, or fatal messages outputted. So, they're probably seeing no logs at all, which is why they might have included an image showing a blank output.

Now, considering the label ""package management"", I need to assess if that's appropriate. Package management issues usually relate to installing, updating, or managing dependencies—like using npm, yarn, or deno install. But in this case, the user isn't reporting an issue with installing log4js; they have it imported but it's not working as expected.

The core of the problem seems to be that the log4js package isn't functioning correctly within Deno. Maybe there are compatibility issues because Deno has a different module resolution system or security settings that affect how npm packages work. Log4js might rely on Node.js-specific features like the 'module' system or certain require paths, which Deno doesn't support in the same way.

So, if I were to label this issue correctly, it's more about compatibility between log4js and Deno rather than package management. The user isn't having trouble installing the package; they're facing issues with its functionality within a specific environment (Deno). Therefore, a more accurate label might be ""compatibility"" or something related to Deno integration.

Since the provided label is ""package management"", I don't think it accurately reflects the issue because this isn't about managing packages but rather about how log4js works in Deno. So, the label doesn't fit.

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue report. 

First, looking at the title: ""Web extension `broadcomMFD.hlasm-language-support` no longer works."" That sounds like something isn't functioning as expected, which typically points to a bug.

Then, the body of the issue provides detailed steps to reproduce the problem, mentions that it occurs across different versions and platforms, and includes error messages. This thorough description supports the idea that there's an unexpected behavior in the code, which aligns with a bug report.

The patches provided show changes to the Content Security Policy (CSP), specifically adding `http://localhost:*` to script-src. This suggests that the issue was due to security policies blocking necessary scripts, which is a code-level problem. Fixing this required modifying the CSP settings, indicating it's a bug fix rather than a feature request or other type of issue.

So, all parts—title, body, and patches—support that this is indeed a bug report. Therefore, the label ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as a bug because the problem described involves unexpected behavior in the codebase, requiring specific fixes to resolve it.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title and body of the issue.

The title says: ""Web extension `broadcomMFD.hlasm-language-support` no longer works."" That immediately tells me something isn't functioning as expected with a specific web extension in VS Code. The word ""no longer"" suggests it was working before but now isn't, which points towards a regression or a bug.

Now looking at the body, the user provides a lot of detailed information. They mention steps to reproduce the issue, including opening a codebase, installing dependencies, and running the extension in debug mode. The result is a non-functional VS Code with disconnected mounts and the extension not loading. There are also errors when clicking in the file tree and messy DevTools console outputs.

They tested this across different versions of @vscode/test-web (v0.22 to v0.56), which suggests they've tried to isolate if it's a version-specific problem or a broader issue. They even checked on multiple operating systems—MacOS, Ubuntu, Windows 10—and found the same behavior everywhere.

The user also made sure to note that this doesn't seem like an issue with vscode-test-web by testing different scenarios and versions. This thorough investigation indicates they've ruled out common causes and pinpointed it as a problem within VS Code itself rather than their setup or other extensions.

Furthermore, they explicitly state that the problem occurs even when all extensions are disabled (Yes/No question answered Yes). That's significant because if disabling extensions didn't resolve the issue, it points more towards a core bug in VS Code rather than an extension conflict.

Given all this, the user is clearly reporting an unexpected behavior or defect in the software, which fits the definition of a bug. The label ""bug"" accurately captures that this isn't a feature request or something else, but a genuine issue affecting functionality.

elastic/elasticsearch,119747,authentication,Refreshing S3 web identity token fails due to missing socket permission,"In <URL> we added support for refreshing web identity credentials when the relevant file on disk is changed. However, the refresh call is not issued with sufficient permissions and it leads to the refresh call failing with:
```The log indicates a `WARN` level warning from Elasticsearch's FileWatcher component at 2024-11-23T04:27:32.

The exception specifies that there is an access denial for the ""java.net.SocketPermission"" related to connecting and resolving ""1.2.3.4:443"".```

The current workaround is to restart the affected nodes. The refresh support was added in 8.13.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""authentication"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is about the S3 web identity token refresh failing due to a missing socket permission. That immediately tells me it's related to security or permissions, specifically around authentication tokens used with Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.

Looking at the body, the user explains that when they added support for refreshing credentials, the refresh call didn't have sufficient permissions. This caused an exception: java.security.AccessControlException related to SocketPermission. The error occurred in the context of AWS credentials and file watchers in Elasticsearch.

The patches provided include a change where the refresh method is now called with doPrivilegedVoid from SocketAccess, which suggests that they're adjusting the security privileges to allow the socket connection needed for refreshing the token. This makes sense because without the proper permissions, the application can't connect to AWS services, hence the authentication failure.

Now, considering the label assigned: ""authentication"". The issue revolves around problems with credentials and their refresh process, which is a part of authentication mechanisms. The fact that it's about web identity tokens and refreshing them points directly to how Elasticsearch authenticates with S3 using these tokens. 

I might think about other possible labels like ""security"" or ""permissions"", but since the problem is specifically about refreshing authentication credentials failing because of permission issues, ""authentication"" seems appropriate. It captures the essence of the issue—trouble with credential management and authentication processes.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the problem described in the issue.
</think>

The label ""authentication"" is appropriate as it directly relates to the issue of credential refresh failure due to insufficient permissions, which affects authentication with S3.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""authentication"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the title and body carefully.

The title is: ""Refreshing S3 web identity token fails due to missing socket permission."" Hmm, this seems related to an error when trying to refresh a token for S3 access. The term ""web identity token"" suggests it's about authentication using some form of identity, probably with AWS since S3 is involved.

Now looking at the body. It mentions that in a specific pull request (104135), support was added for refreshing web identity credentials when a file changes on disk. However, the refresh call doesn't have sufficient permissions, leading to a failure. The error message indicates an AccessControlException related to SocketPermission, specifically connecting to ""1.2.3.4:443"". This port is typically HTTPS, so it's about making a secure connection.

The exception is thrown by AmazonClientException from the AWS SDK, which points towards authentication or authorization issues when trying to refresh credentials. The stack trace includes classes related to STSAssumeRoleWithWebIdentitySessionCredentialsProvider and S3Service, which are definitely part of handling AWS credentials and authentication.

The workaround is restarting affected nodes, but that doesn't change the fact that the root issue is with permissions during token refresh. So, the problem revolves around how credentials are being refreshed and the necessary permissions to perform that action.

Now, considering the label ""authentication."" The issue is about failing to refresh a web identity token due to missing socket permissions. While it's technically an authorization or permission issue when trying to connect (which is more of a networking/permission problem), the context is within authentication processes—specifically, refreshing credentials for S3 access.

In GitHub issues, labels often reflect the broader category. Authentication could encompass problems related to credential management, token refreshes, and permissions required during these processes. Even though it's a permission issue at its core, it arises in the context of authenticating with AWS services (S3). So, labeling it as authentication makes sense because it's part of how the system handles credentials and authentication tokens.

Alternatively, one might argue that ""permissions"" or ""security"" could be more precise, but if those labels aren't available, ""authentication"" is a suitable fit. It accurately reflects that the problem is tied to authenticating with S3 using web identity tokens, even though the specific error is about socket permissions.
</think>

The label ""authentication"" accurately reflects the issue because it pertains to problems encountered during the refresh of credentials for accessing S3 via web identity tokens. The issue arises in the context of credential management and authentication processes, making ""authentication"" an appropriate label.

rust-lang/rust,129707,enhancement,rustdoc search: allow queries to end in ::,"for example, `Vec::` should show all associated items of `Vec`.

@rustbot label A-rustdoc-search
@rustbot claim








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is ""rustdoc search: allow queries to end in ::"". The body explains that when a user searches for something like `Vec::`, it should show all associated items of `Vec`. They also mention using the label A-rustdoc-search and have some bot commands. 

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies some JavaScript code related to parsing queries in rustdoc's search functionality. It removes checks that prevent paths from ending with ""::"". So, it allows the query to end with double colons.

Patch 2 removes a test case where a query ending with ""::"" was previously causing an error. This suggests that the behavior is being changed to allow such endings.

Patch 3 adds an expected result for a query like ""Option::"", which should return specific items, indicating that the search now correctly handles trailing ""::"".

The label assigned is ""enhancement"". I need to decide if this is correct. An enhancement usually refers to a new feature or improvement rather than a bug fix.

In this case, allowing queries to end with ""::"" adds functionality to the search, making it more flexible and user-friendly. It's not fixing a bug but improving how the tool works, which fits the definition of an enhancement.

So yes, the label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects this issue.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""rustdoc search: allow queries to end in ::"". It seems like someone is suggesting a new feature or improvement to how rustdoc handles searches. The double colon :: in Rust typically refers to namespace or associated items, so allowing searches ending with :: could help developers find associated functions or constants more easily.

Now, the body says that `Vec::` should show all associated items of `Vec`. This is an example where the user wants a specific behavior added—when you type `Vec::`, rustdoc's search should display related items. That sounds like a feature request because it's about adding functionality to make the tool more useful or user-friendly.

The labels in GitHub issues often categorize whether something is a bug, enhancement, question, etc. Since this isn't fixing a bug but rather asking for a new capability, ""enhancement"" makes sense here. It's not a bug fix because there's no mention of anything being broken; it's about improving the search functionality.

I also notice that in the body, they used @rustbot to label it as A-rustdoc-search and claimed it. That doesn't affect the enhancement label but shows it's part of their process for organizing issues.

So putting it all together: the issue is a request for adding a feature to rustdoc search, which fits under ""enhancement."" There’s no indication that this is a bug or anything else. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" correctly categorizes the issue as it requests a new feature in rustdoc's search functionality.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42002,forward port,Maven plugin integration tests cannot run against release local repository,Forward port of issue #42001 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Maven plugin integration tests cannot run against release local repository."" This suggests that there was a problem with Maven plugin tests not running correctly when using a local release repository. The body mentions it's a forward port of issue #42001 to the 3.4.x branch, which indicates they're taking a fix from another version and applying it here.

Now, examining the patches provided: Patch 1 shows additions to the build.gradle file. Specifically, two new mavenRepository entries are added. One points to spring-boot-dependencies and the other to spring-boot-starter-parent. These changes seem aimed at correctly resolving dependencies during testing, which would address why the tests couldn't run before.

The term ""forward port"" in software development usually refers to taking a bug fix from an older version (or a different branch) and applying it to a newer version or another branch. In this case, since they're forwarding issue #42001 to 3.4.x, that fits the definition of a forward port.

So, putting it all together: The issue was about a problem in Maven integration tests, which required adding more dependency repositories. This fix was taken from a previous issue and applied here. Therefore, labeling it as ""forward port"" is accurate because they're bringing an existing fix into another branch to resolve the same issue there.

I don't see any conflicting information. The patches align with the problem described, and the label correctly describes the action of moving a fix from one place to another.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what a forward port typically means in software development. A forward port usually refers to taking changes or fixes from one version of the codebase and applying them to a future version. This is common when maintaining different branches, especially for bug fixes that need to be applied across multiple versions.

Looking at the issue title: ""Maven plugin integration tests cannot run against release local repository."" The title suggests there's an issue with Maven plugin tests not running correctly in a specific environment—probably after some changes or under certain conditions. It points to a problem that needs fixing, but doesn't immediately indicate whether it's a forward port.

Now, examining the body: ""Forward port of issue #42001 to 3.4.x."" This directly states that this issue is a forward port. The term ""forward port"" is explicitly used here, indicating that the content from another issue (#42001) is being moved or applied to version 3.4.x.

Given that the body clearly mentions it's a forward port of a previous issue, the label ""forward port"" seems appropriate. It accurately describes the action taken with this issue report. The title alone might not have been clear without the body context, but combined, they support the use of the label.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" is accurate because the issue explicitly states that it's a forward port from another issue to version 3.4.x.

angular/angular,55115,template,Using this keyword in templates will use template varibales instead of component variables.,"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?

Don't known / other

### Is this a regression?

No

### Description

When defining a variable inside of a template (for example setting a variable with $index in a loop), using `this.` in combination with that variable will resolve to the local template variable and not the component variable.

`````This TypeScript code snippet defines an Angular component with a standalone decorator. It uses a template syntax to iterate over `list` and display each item along with an index. The index is intended to be displayed as `idx`, but the template logic sets it to `$index` instead. The `list` contains a single item ""hello"", and there is a mismatch in the index variable name between the component property and the template.```

This shows `0 hello` instead of `this should be idx hello`.

### Anything else?

We noticed this by accident, obviously not a show-stopper, we just have a co-worker who's convinced he should use the `this` keyword in templates and doesn't want to stop.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""template"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The issue's title is: ""Using this keyword in templates will use template variables instead of component variables."" This suggests that when using `this` in a template, it refers to template variables rather than component ones, which might not be the intended behavior.

Looking at the body, the user provided an example where `{{ this.idx }}` inside a loop uses the local index variable from the template instead of the component's property. They also included code snippets and a stackblitz link for reproduction, which indicates it's a bug report regarding how `this` behaves in templates.

Now, examining the patches made to resolve the issue:

1. **Patch 1** modifies the condition in `TcbExpressionTranslator` to exclude `ThisReceiver`, preventing `this` from referring to template variables.
2. **Patches 2-5 and 8** adjust templates to remove `this.` usage, which suggests that the problem lies within how the template compiler interprets `this`.
3. **Patch 6** changes conditions in `convertAst` to only convert implicit receivers, avoiding explicit `this` reads.
4. **Patches 7** adds tests ensuring that `this.value` doesn't resolve to template variables.

All these patches focus on the behavior of `this` within templates and how the compiler resolves variable references. The issue is about how Angular's templating system handles scope when using `this`, specifically in contexts where both component and template variables exist.

The label ""template"" seems appropriate because the problem is directly related to Angular's template engine and how it processes expressions, especially those involving `this`. The bug and its fixes are centered around the templating system, not other areas like routing or forms.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to the behavior within templates.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""template"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue. Let's start by reading through the issue details.

The title says: ""Using this keyword in templates will use template variables instead of component variables."" That immediately tells me it's about how using 'this' in templates affects variable resolution.

Looking at the body, the user provides a code example where they're using `this.idx` inside a template. They expected it to refer to the component's `idx`, but it instead uses the local template variable `$index`. The issue is that the output shows ""0 hello"" from the loop index rather than the component's value.

They also mention that this isn't a regression, so it might be a known behavior or a bug in how Angular handles 'this' in templates. The minimal reproduction link and environment info are provided, which is helpful for debugging.

The label assigned was ""template"". Since the issue revolves around how variables are resolved when using `this` within templates, the label seems appropriate because the core of the problem lies within the template syntax and variable scoping.

I don't see any other labels mentioned like 'bug' or 'regression', but since they specifically talk about template behavior, ""template"" is a fitting category. It helps in organizing issues related to Angular's templating system.
</think>

The label ""template"" accurately reflects the issue because it pertains to how variables are resolved when using `this` within templates.

gohugoio/hugo,12805,rendering,Extend blockquote alerts to support Obsidian AlertTitle,"In addition to custom alert typo (see #12801) it would also be nice to support [Obsidian's callout titles](<URL> too. At least enough for me to use a blockquote render hook to support it. As is, if this markdown is sent to the render hook:

```The code snippet is a markdown format note indicating that alerts are an effective way to highlight information for the reader.```

The the text ""Alerts are awesome"" (the ""title"") is not passed to the render hook at all; it just vanishes. It would be great if the render hook got `.AlertTitle` or something so I could implement an alert with a title myself, even if the default was to do nothing with it (current behavior).

However, the following illustrates how GitHub handles things.

----

> [!NOTE] Title Test
> Title Test 1: I have a title

> [!NOTE]
> Title Test 2: I have no title

----

As you can see, GitHub doesn't even render the blockquote as an alert if there's a title. So maybe Hugo's current behavior should be considered a bug (feel free to change the tag to ""bug"" if you agree). If a title is present then Hugo shouldn't consider the blockquote to be an alert at all; `.AlertType` should be empty and `.Text` should contain the entire contents of the blockquote. Fixing this would allow me to parse the title myself if I want to.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""rendering"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches.

First, let's look at the issue's title: ""Extend blockquote alerts to support Obsidian AlertTitle."" This suggests that the problem is about enhancing how blockquotes are rendered when they include titles in the Obsidian format. The title directly mentions rendering aspects related to alerts and their titles.

Next, the body of the issue explains that currently, when using Obsidian-style callouts with titles, the title isn't passed to the render hook, causing it to vanish. The user wants the render hook to receive this information so they can implement custom rendering. They also mention that GitHub doesn't render blockquotes as alerts if a title is present, implying that there's an issue with how these are being processed.

Looking at the patches provided:

1. Patch 1 adds documentation for new fields AlertTitle and AlertSign in the context passed to the render hook. This indicates that the code now includes these new properties, allowing them to be accessed during rendering.
2. Patch 2 modifies the BlockquoteContext interface to include methods for AlertTitle() and AlertSign(). These are new additions that directly relate to how alerts are rendered with their titles and signs.
3. Patch 3 changes the way alerts are resolved. It introduces a struct blockQuoteAlert which includes typ, sign, and title fields. This means the rendering logic now parses and handles these additional attributes extracted from the markdown.
4. Patch 4 adds tests that check if the new fields (AlertType, AlertTitle, AlertSign) are correctly passed to the render hook. The tests cover various scenarios with titles and signs, ensuring proper rendering behavior.
5. Patch 5 updates a test function to use the new blockQuoteAlert struct, ensuring that different inputs (including those with titles and signs) are correctly parsed.

All these patches focus on enhancing how blockquote alerts are processed and rendered, particularly extending support for Obsidian's callout features like titles and foldable signs. The changes involve modifying context variables, parsing logic, and tests to ensure that the rendering accurately reflects these new attributes.

Given this analysis, the issue is indeed about improving the rendering of blockquotes with specific attention to handling new alert title and sign syntax from Obsidian. Therefore, the label ""rendering"" is appropriate as it directly relates to how content is displayed in the application.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""rendering"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The title of the issue says: ""Extend blockquote alerts to support Obsidian AlertTitle."" Hmm, that suggests the user wants to add a new feature related to how blockquotes are handled, specifically with titles in alerts. They mention something about custom alert types from another issue and link to Obsidian's documentation on callouts.

In the body, they explain that currently when using a specific markdown syntax for alerts with titles, the title text isn't passed to the render hook. This means the title just disappears, which is a problem because they want to handle it themselves in their rendering logic. They provide an example where the title doesn't show up and how GitHub handles similar cases by not rendering blockquotes as alerts if there's a title.

The user also suggests that this might be a bug because Hugo isn't behaving correctly when titles are present. They propose that if a title exists, Hugo shouldn't treat it as an alert and should instead include the entire content without splitting into AlertType or Text. This way, they can parse it themselves.

Now, looking at the label ""rendering."" The issue is about how blockquotes with titles are processed during rendering. The user wants to modify the rendering behavior so that titles are properly handled and passed through render hooks. They're talking about how Hugo's current rendering logic ignores the title, which affects how their custom alerts work.

So, does this fall under ""rendering""? Yes, because it's about the output and processing of markdown into HTML or another format. The problem is with how the content is being rendered, especially concerning blockquote alerts and their titles.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here like bug or feature request, but even if it were a bug, ""rendering"" still applies because the core issue is about rendering behavior not working as expected.

Therefore, I think the label accurately reflects the problem described.

JuliaLang/julia,55459,compatibility,"push!, append! AbstractVector implementations no longer work on Julia 1.11+","Implementing `Base.resize!` used to be sufficient for `push!` and `append!` to work on Julia 1.10 and prior.

Consider the following `Vector` wrapper.

```This Julia code defines a custom vector type `MyVector` that wraps a standard Julia `Vector{Int}`. It includes methods to implement the required `AbstractVector{Int}` interface:

- `size` method to return the size of the vector.
- `getindex` method to access elements.
- `setindex!` method to modify elements.```

Attempting to use `push!` would suggest the implementation of `resize!`:

```The code snippet initializes a `MyVector` with five undefined elements and attempts to append a value of `1` using `push!`. It results in a `MethodError` because `MyVector` does not have a `resize!` method implemented, which is required for appending elements.```

After implmenting `resize!` as follows,

```This code snippet defines a method `resize!` for a type `MyVector` in Julia. It resizes the underlying vector `v` of type `MyVector` to the specified size `nl`.```

this allows `push!` to work on Julia 1.10.

```The code snippet initializes a `MyVector` with 5 undefined elements and then demonstrates using `push!` to add an element to the vector and `append!` to add multiple elements, resulting in a `MyVector` with 9 elements.```

On Julia 1.11-rc2, this no longer works:
`````The code snippet demonstrates creating a `MyVector` object with 5 elements and then attempting to add an element to it using `push!`. The attempt fails due to a `MethodError`, indicating that there is no method defined for `sizehint!` for `MyVector` with an integer argument. This error suggests that `MyVector` does not have the necessary implementation for methods like `push!` or `sizehint!`.```

Following the suggestion, an implementation of `sizehint!` leads to StackOverflow error on Julia 1.11:

```The code snippet defines a method `sizehint!` for a custom vector type `MyVector` that delegates to the base implementation. However, using this method leads to a `StackOverflowError` when calling `push!` or `append!` on an instance of `MyVector`. The error occurs because the `sizehint!` method is called recursively, causing an infinite loop and exhausting the stack.```

As of #51903, `append!(a::AbstractVector, iter)` depends on `push!(a::AbstractVector, iter...)`. This is problematic because `push!(a::AbstractVector, iter...)` depends on `append!(a::AbstractVector, iter)` which leads to the above stack overflow condition.

<URL>

The new implementation of `append!` suggests that we should modify the generic implementation of `push!` for `AbstractVector`:

```This Julia code snippet defines a custom implementation of the `push!` function for `AbstractVector` types. It first checks if the input is an `AbstractVector`, and if so, it increases the vector's length by one, resizes the vector to accommodate the new element, adds the specified value `v` at the new end position, and returns the modified vector. Additionally, it overloads `push!` to accept multiple arguments (iterable elements) and appends them to the vector using `append!`.```

Importantly, this new implementation of `push!` now only depends on the `AbstractArray` interface and an implementation of `resize!`.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""compatibility"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""push!, append! AbstractVector implementations no longer work on Julia 1.11+"". This immediately tells me that something stopped working when moving from Julia 1.10 to 1.11, which suggests a compatibility issue because functionality broke with an update.

The body of the issue describes how custom AbstractVector implementations were working correctly up to Julia 1.10 by implementing `resize!`, but on 1.11, using `push!` or `append!` causes errors. The user tried adding `sizehint!` but ended up with a stack overflow instead. They reference another GitHub issue (#51903) and changes in the implementation of `append!` that now depend on `push!`, leading to circular dependencies.

The patches provided show modifications to the base array functions, particularly introducing new generic versions of `push!` for AbstractVectors, including type conversions and handling multiple items. There's also a test added to ensure that `push!` works correctly with various arguments across different array types.

Now, considering the label ""compatibility"": This term generally refers to ensuring that code works across different versions or environments without issues. In this case, the problem arises because of changes in Julia 1.11 that broke existing functionality which worked before. The patches aim to restore compatibility by adjusting how `push!` and related functions work for AbstractVectors.

The issue is about adapting code to maintain functionality across version updates, which fits well under compatibility. The fixes aren't introducing new features but ensuring that existing code works as intended after changes in the language or standard libraries.

So yes, the label ""compatibility"" accurately reflects this problem because it's about maintaining functionality across different versions of Julia.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""compatibility"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by reading through the problem described.

The issue title says that `push!` and `append!` implementations no longer work on Julia 1.11+. The body explains that in earlier versions of Julia, implementing `Base.resize!` was sufficient for these functions to work. However, starting from Julia 1.11, when they tried to use `push!`, it threw an error because `sizehint!` wasn't implemented for their custom vector type. When they added `sizehint!`, it caused a stack overflow due to a cyclic dependency between `append!` and `push!`.

So the problem is about functions that worked in older versions but broke in newer versions of Julia. This suggests an issue with compatibility across different Julia versions.

The label ""compatibility"" is often used for issues where code stops working when moving from one version to another, which fits here because the user's code worked on 1.10 but fails on 1.11+. The problem isn't about a bug in the code itself or a new feature request; it's specifically about something breaking due to changes in Julia's behavior between versions.

Therefore, labeling this as ""compatibility"" makes sense because it highlights that the issue arises from version changes affecting existing functionality.
</think>

The label ""compatibility"" accurately reflects the issue since it pertains to functionality breaking across different Julia versions.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42267,forward port,Fix deprecation warning caused by the testResultsOverview build service being used without a corresponding declaration,Forward port of issue #42266 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Fix deprecation warning caused by the testResultsOverview build service being used without a corresponding declaration."" This seems like it's addressing a specific problem where a certain service isn't declared properly, leading to a deprecation warning. The fix is about resolving that warning.

Next, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #42266 to 3.4.x."" Hmm, this clearly mentions that this issue is a forward port of another issue. So the main purpose here is taking changes from one branch (probably a newer or different version) and applying them to the 3.4.x branch.

Now looking at the patches provided. The first patch updates the copyright year from 2023 to 2024, which seems minor but necessary for versioning. The second part of the patch modifies how a test listener is added. Instead of directly adding the listener, it now uses `test.usesService(testResultsOverview);` before adding the listener. This change likely ensures that the service is properly declared before use, which would fix the deprecation warning mentioned in the title.

Putting this together: The issue is about fixing a deprecation warning by correctly declaring a service. However, the body explicitly states it's a forward port from another issue. The patches made are indeed applying changes to resolve the issue, but they're part of a forward port process. So the label ""forward port"" makes sense here because the primary action was taking existing changes and moving them to another branch or version line (3.4.x).

Wait, but does the label capture both the purpose of the issue and the nature of the fix? The issue's title is about fixing a problem, while the body clarifies it's a forward port. So the label ""forward port"" is more about how the fix was implemented (by porting existing changes) rather than what the fix achieves.

But in GitHub issues, labels often indicate the type or category of the issue. If this issue exists solely to move changes from one branch to another, then labeling it as a forward port makes sense. The patches themselves are part of that process, even though they address a specific bug.

So I think the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects that this issue is about taking existing work (from #42266) and applying it to the 3.4.x branch. Therefore, yes, the label fits.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue as described in both the body and the patches applied. The issue's purpose was to forward port changes from another issue to a different version branch.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""Fix deprecation warning caused by the testResultsOverview build service being used without a corresponding declaration."" This tells me that the main purpose of the issue is to fix a deprecation warning related to a specific build service. The problem arises because the service is used without proper declaration, which is causing the warning.

Now, moving on to the body: ""Forward port of issue #42266 to 3.4.x."" This indicates that the current issue is taking something from another issue (number 42266) and applying it or moving it to a different branch or version, specifically 3.4.x. The term ""forward port"" typically refers to taking changes from one codebase and integrating them into another, often for different versions.

So, putting this together, the body explicitly mentions that this issue is a forward port of another issue. That means the primary action here is moving or adapting existing work (probably a fix) from one place to another, likely to ensure compatibility with version 3.4.x.

The label ""forward port"" seems to capture exactly what's happening here. The title describes the technical problem being addressed, but the body clarifies that this is part of a process to move or adapt existing work into a new context. Therefore, the label accurately reflects both the action (forward porting) and the purpose (fixing a deprecation warning by applying prior solutions).

I don't see any mismatch here. The label isn't about the specific technical fix but rather the process taken to address it, which is exactly what ""forward port"" signifies in software development terms.

microsoft/vscode,211374,bug,Dataloss when renaming file two times,"Hello everyone.

Microsoft has a lot of text editor on their different products and I have come to a way of working (which might not be the best of all in some cases) and it seems like using Visual Studio Code in a manner allows the customer, like myself, to be loosing its file progress when renaming a file. 

This happened after I wanted to rename a java class, for example, “myclass.java” to “MyClass.java”.
Since the change lookup is case insensitive, they both are of equal names which will result in no name change, so you will have to rename the file to a temporary name in order to make your change.

Now the following process will come in to the bug to be fixed.

- Create a new file name “myclass.java”.
- Enter the following code into that file (replace the content if necessary):

```This code snippet defines a public class named `myclass` with a default public constructor.```

- Now save the file.
- Now add this method to the class:
```The code snippet defines a method named `myMethod` that is currently empty and marked as ""My work in progress..."".```

- Now without saving this time. Rename the file using the right-click in the object-browser pane of the VSCode to “temporaryname.java”. You will see the file has the same content but with the new name.
- Now rename the file again like before to “MyClass.java”. Now, it will be taking the last saved file named “myclass.java” and take its content instead of taking the current file content. Therefore loosing all work in progress. In this case, the class myclass will no longer have the method myMethod(), and there will be an error from the intellisense since the class myclass does not equal MyClass.

Now I know that saving will fix all of this. BUT, Microsoft, as a reliable source for text editing, at least I would have liked a minimum of a prompt of “Are you sure you want to rename the file to ""newNameFile""? The work in progress might be loss.”

This is very common for I to do this in other Microsoft text editing products and this seems to be a bug to be fixed. Allowing the customer to loose its progress without warning is a bug to me.

All thanks.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""Dataloss when renaming file two times."" This suggests that there's an issue where data is lost during a specific operation, which sounds like unintended behavior—commonly referred to as a bug.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user describes a scenario where they rename a file twice in VSCode, leading to loss of unsaved work. They explain the steps clearly and mention that without saving after each change, renaming causes data loss. They also suggest that a warning prompt would be helpful, implying this is unexpected behavior.

The patches provided are two code snippets from different files. Both seem to modify how file operations are handled, specifically using canonical URIs to prevent stale states. The comments explicitly reference the issue number and mention fixing a potential data loss problem. This indicates that the developers acknowledged it as an issue requiring a fix.

Considering all these points—the title indicating data loss, the detailed description of unexpected behavior, and patches addressing the problem—it's clear that this is a bug report. Therefore, the label ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the title: ""Dataloss when renaming file two times."" This immediately suggests that something is going wrong with data being lost during a specific action, which is a rename operation done twice. Data loss typically indicates an unexpected behavior or flaw in the software's functionality.

Now, examining the body of the issue, the user describes a detailed scenario where they're renaming a Java file in Visual Studio Code. They explain that when trying to change the case from ""myclass.java"" to ""MyClass.java,"" which isn't possible directly because the system is case-insensitive, they use a temporary name. However, upon renaming twice without saving in between, their unsaved changes are lost. The user points out that this results in data loss and suggests that a warning prompt would be appropriate.

The key elements here are unexpected behavior leading to data loss. The user clearly states that this is a bug because it causes them to lose their work without any warning. They also mention that this is common across Microsoft's text editors, implying it's a recurring issue rather than user error.

Labels in GitHub issues usually categorize problems as bugs, feature requests, or other types. Since the report describes an unintended behavior leading to data loss, which negatively impacts functionality and user experience, labeling it as a ""bug"" is appropriate. It's not a feature request because the user isn't asking for new functionality but rather pointing out a flaw that needs fixing.

Therefore, considering all these points, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue described.

rust-lang/rust,119697,unsoundness,let_underscore_drop hallunicates variable binding,"### Code

`````The code snippet defines a Rust struct `Foo` with a `String` field, and a type alias `Tait` that implements `Sized`. It includes a function `ice_cold` that takes a value of type `Tait`, destructures it into a `Foo` instance, and then attempts to drop the `field` string, which triggers a compilation warning due to unused variable `_ = field`. The `main` function is empty.```


### Current output

`````````The log shows two warnings related to the `let_underscore_drop` lint in Rust:

1. A non-binding `let` statement is being dropped immediately.
2. The lint level for this warning is set in the file.

These warnings suggest that variables declared with `_` are being dropped without being bound to another variable, which can lead to unnecessary resource cleanup.```


### Desired output

```````The log indicates that the code suggests using `_unused = filed` because `_unused` is not in scope, but it implies that `_unused` is intended to be used as a placeholder for `filed`.```


### Rationale and extra context

Otherwise it will fail to cargo-fix:
`````````The code snippet shows an error message indicating that Rust cannot find a value named `_unused` in the current scope on line 15.

### Anything else?

_No response_",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""unsoundness"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is ""let_underscore_drop hallunicates variable binding."" Hmm, that seems a bit technical. From the body, it looks like there's some Rust code provided with certain warnings and desired outputs.

Looking at the code example in the body, they're using a lint called let_underscore_drop. The warning says something about a non-binding let on a type that implements Drop. So, I think this is related to how variables are bound or dropped in Rust.

The user wants the suggestion when this lint triggers to propose binding to an unused variable instead of just using `_ = field;`. They mention that previously, suggesting `_unused = field` without introducing `let` causes a compile error because `_unused` isn't declared. So the fix involves adding `let _unused = field;`.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are several patches, but they seem to modify how the lint behaves and what suggestions it gives. For example, Patch 3 changes the suggestion to include ""let"" if it's an assign desugar situation. Other patches add test cases where the lint should trigger and check that the correct suggestions are made.

The key here is whether the label ""unsoundness"" fits this issue. Unsoundness in programming languages refers to a situation where a program can violate the type system, leading to incorrect behavior without runtime errors. But in this case, the issue is about linter warnings related to variable binding and dropping values.

This doesn't seem to involve any unsoundness because it's not about bypassing type safety or causing undefined behavior. Instead, it's more about code style, best practices for avoiding unnecessary drops, and improving the user experience with better error messages.

So, the label ""unsoundness"" might be incorrect here. The problem is more about usability of the lint system rather than any soundness issues in the language itself.
</think>

The issue revolves around a Rust linter warning related to variable binding and dropping values, aiming to improve code suggestions without affecting type safety. It doesn't involve unsoundness.

0",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""unsoundness"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what's going on in the problem.

The issue is about a Rust code that generates a warning related to `let_underscore_drop`. The user provided some Rust code where they're using a type alias and destructuring a struct. They're getting a warning because the compiler thinks that a value implementing `Drop` is being immediately dropped, which might not be intended.

The problem arises when trying to apply the suggested fix from the warning. The suggestion is to either bind the value to an unused variable or drop it explicitly. However, when they try to use `_unused = field;`, it results in an error because `_unused` isn't declared as a variable. They expected that using `let _unused = field;` would work without issues.

The key point here is that the original code's suggestion leads to a compiler error due to a missing variable declaration. The user is pointing out that the fix suggested by the warning is incorrect because it doesn't account for the need to declare `_unused` with `let`.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""unsoundness."" From what I know about Rust, ""soundness"" refers to the correctness and safety guarantees of the language. An unsoundness issue would mean that the type system or some other core part of the language is allowing incorrect or unsafe behavior, potentially leading to runtime errors or undefined behavior.

In this case, the problem isn't about the type system being broken or allowing unsafe code. Instead, it's a usability issue with the warning message not providing correct suggestions. The suggestion leads to an error because it doesn't include the necessary `let` keyword for variable binding. This seems more like a bug in the compiler's suggestion rather than an unsoundness problem.

Unsoundness would involve scenarios where the compiler allows code that violates Rust's safety guarantees, such as dereferencing a null pointer without checks or allowing data races. Here, the issue is about incorrect code generation from a warning message, which doesn't affect the correctness of the language but rather the user experience and tooling.

So, considering all this, the label ""unsoundness"" doesn't fit because the problem isn't related to the compiler's ability to enforce memory safety or type correctness. Instead, it's a bug in how the compiler provides feedback, which should be labeled as a ""bug"" or maybe something like ""user experience"" or ""tooling"" issue.

Therefore, I conclude that the label ""unsoundness"" is not accurate for this report.

golang/go,69526,bug,text/template: incorrect error line number reporting after multiline comments,"### Go version

go version go1.23.0 darwin/amd64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```This code snippet appears to be a collection of environment variables related to the Go programming language setup on a macOS system with ARM64 architecture. It includes details such as the Go version, paths to various directories and tools, compiler flags, and other configuration settings.```


### What did you do?

I encountered a problem with incorrect error line number reporting when using the `text/template` package. Specifically, if a template has a multiline comment (e.g., `{{/* ... */}}`), and an error occurs (such as an undefined function) on a line immediately after the comment, the reported error line is incorrect and points to the start of the comment block or earlier.

Example code [<URL>
`````The code initializes a Go template from a multiline comment and an undefined function call, then attempts to parse and execute the template, logging errors if they occur.```

### What did you see happen?

The error reported the wrong line number):

`Template parse error: template: test:2: function ""undefinedFunction"" not defined`

### What did you expect to see?

I expected the error to report the correct line where the undefined function is used:

`Template parse error: template: test:5: function ""undefinedFunction"" not defined",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" correctly reflects the issue reported in the GitHub issue. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""text/template: incorrect error line number reporting after multiline comments."" This suggests there's a problem with how line numbers are reported when errors occur near multiline comments in templates. That definitely sounds like a bug because it's about incorrect behavior in the code.

Next, I read through the body of the issue. The user explains that when using the text/template package, if an error occurs right after a multiline comment, the error message points to the wrong line number. They provided example code and demonstrated that the error reports line 2 instead of the correct line 5 where the undefined function is called. This indicates unexpected behavior in the software, which aligns with what a bug is.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved the issue. Patch 1 modifies the lexer to correctly count lines within comments by adding the number of newlines in the comment content. This ensures that after a multiline comment, the line numbers for subsequent errors are accurate. Patch 2 updates the test cases to include scenarios with long comments followed by undefined functions, which helps verify that the bug is fixed.

The label ""bug"" is assigned because it accurately describes an issue where the system doesn't behave as intended. The error reporting was incorrect, and the patches fix this behavior, so labeling it as a bug makes sense.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because the problem involves incorrect line number reporting in error messages, which is unexpected behavior fixed by specific code changes.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me read through the problem again.

The user reported an issue with the `text/template` package in Go. The problem occurs when there's a multiline comment followed by an error on the next line. Instead of pointing to the correct line after the comment, the error message shows an earlier line number.

Looking at their example code, they have a template that starts with a multiline comment. Then, on the line immediately following, they call `undefinedFunction`, which isn't defined. When parsing this, Go reports the error as being on line 2, where the comment starts, rather than line 5 where the function is called.

So, what defines a bug? A bug is an unintended behavior in the software that causes it to produce incorrect results or behave unexpectedly. In this case, the error reporting mechanism isn't working correctly when there's a multiline comment before the mistake. That seems like a clear bug because the system should accurately report where the error occurs.

The user also provided their Go environment and a sample code snippet, which makes it easier for developers to reproduce and understand the issue. This thoroughness is typical of bug reports, as it helps in diagnosing the problem.

I don't see any indication that this is a feature request or something else. The incorrect line numbering isn't something users would expect or consider normal behavior. Therefore, labeling it as a bug makes sense because it's an actual defect in how errors are reported.

denoland/deno,26508,formatting,Deno panicked formatting a HTML file,"Version: Deno 2.0.2

I have the following file:

`````````This HTML code snippet creates a web page that displays a bar chart and detailed data. It includes:

- Basic HTML structure with a title set dynamically.
- CSS for styling, including a responsive body layout and grid display for data list items.
- JavaScript to fetch and process JSON data from `./monthly-visits.json`, then:
  - Create a bar chart using the `frappe.Chart` library.
  - Update the document title.
  - Dynamically generate and insert HTML content into the `#details` div to display dataset names and corresponding formatted numerical values.```

The formatter is not producing stable results, failing 5 times. As a temporary workaround, the user can ignore this file. The log includes a detailed stack trace.```

It looks like the cause is this piece of code inside the `<script>` tag:

`````````The code snippet sets the `innerHTML` of an element with the ID `details` to dynamically generate HTML content based on `datasets`. It iterates over each dataset, creating an `<h2>` for the name and a `<dl>` list for the label-value pairs, formatted using `fmt`.```

If I remove this part, it works fine.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""formatting"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue title is ""Deno panicked formatting a HTML file."" That immediately suggests that Deno crashed when trying to format an HTML file. The body describes how running `deno fmt viewer.html` caused a panic, and the user provided the HTML code and the error output.

Looking at the body, the user mentions that the problem seems to be with a specific part of the JavaScript code inside the `<script>` tag. They even tested by removing that part and it worked fine. So, the issue is related to how Deno's formatter handles certain JavaScript code within HTML files.

Now, checking the patches applied to fix this issue. There are three patches:

1. Updates a plugin from version 0.93.0 to 0.93.1.
2. Upgrades ""markup_fmt"" from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0 and updates its checksum.
3. Similarly, another patch upgrades ""markup_fmt"" in the workspace dependencies.

The ""markup_fmt"" crate is related to formatting markup languages like HTML. Updating it suggests that the bug was in how Deno formats HTML files, possibly when they contain embedded JavaScript.

So, putting it all together: The issue arises during the formatting of an HTML file because of specific JavaScript code. The patches address the formatter's handling of such cases by updating relevant dependencies. Therefore, the label ""formatting"" is spot on because the problem is directly tied to Deno's formatting functionality.

I don't see any other aspects here like performance or security; it's clearly about formatting not working correctly and causing a panic.
</think>

The issue revolves around Deno's formatter crashing when processing an HTML file with specific JavaScript code. The patches target the formatter's dependencies, confirming that the problem lies within the formatting functionality.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The user is asking if the label ""formatting"" accurately reflects their GitHub issue report about Deno panicking when formatting an HTML file.

First, I look at the title: ""Deno panicked formatting a HTML file."" This immediately points to an issue related to formatting. The body of the issue provides more details, including the error message from running `deno fmt viewer.html`. The error mentions that formatting isn't stable and suggests it's a bug in the formatter.

The user also includes the specific code causing the problem, which is within a script tag where they're dynamically generating HTML content using JavaScript. They mention that removing this part fixes the issue, indicating that the problem lies with how Deno's formatter handles this particular code snippet.

Given all this information, the label ""formatting"" seems appropriate because the issue revolves around Deno's formatting tool misbehaving when processing certain code structures in an HTML file. The user's description aligns well with a formatting-related bug.
</think>

The label ""formatting"" accurately reflects the issue report as it pertains to problems with Deno's formatter.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33565,filter,UrlHandlerFilter should not strip the trailing slash from the contextPath URL,"Although <URL> has been fixed for root URLs, it looks like there is still a problem with the `UrlHandlerFilter` when `server.servlet.contextPath` is specified.

Here is a minimal application to reproduce it: <URL>

```This line sets the context path for a Spring Boot application server to `/myApp`.```
And use the following `UrlHandlerFilter`:
```This code snippet creates an instance of `UrlHandlerFilter` configured to add a trailing slash for URLs matching `/**` and wraps the request before building the filter.```

And in this case, both `<URL> and `<URL> work fine, however,
`<URL> and `<URL> don't and return  404. 

Controller for the root looks like this:

```This Java code defines a REST controller with a single endpoint that responds to GET requests at the root path and ""/greeting"" with the string ""Hello world!"".```
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""filter"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem.

The issue title says that UrlHandlerFilter should not strip the trailing slash from the contextPath URL. So it's about the behavior of the UrlHandlerFilter in Spring Framework when a context path is set.

Looking at the body, the user explains that even though a previous issue (33444) was fixed for root URLs, there's still an issue when server.servlet.contextPath is specified. They provided a minimal test project and code examples showing how the problem occurs with URLs like /myApp and /myApp/ returning 404 errors.

The patches made to resolve this are in four parts. Patch 1 modifies the canHandle method in AbstractTrailingSlashHandler, changing path.elements() to path.pathWithinApplication().elements(). Similarly, Patches 2, 3, and 4 adjust how paths are handled by considering the contextPath when building requests or handling exchanges.

These patches all relate to how UrlHandlerFilter processes URLs, especially regarding trailing slashes and context paths. The label ""filter"" seems relevant because it directly relates to the functionality of UrlHandlerFilter, which is a filter in Spring Framework that handles URL manipulations.

The issue revolves around the filter's behavior with context paths and trailing slashes. All patches are within classes related to the filter and its handling methods. So, using the label ""filter"" accurately categorizes this problem as it's about how the UrlHandlerFilter is processing URLs.

Therefore, the label ""filter"" does reflect the issue accurately.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""filter"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, let's read the title: ""UrlHandlerFilter should not strip the trailing slash from the contextPath URL."" The title mentions UrlHandlerFilter specifically, which is a class in Spring Framework. So right away, it's clear that the issue is related to this particular filter.

Next, looking at the body of the issue. The user describes a problem with the UrlHandlerFilter when server.servlet.contextPath is set. They provided a minimal application and some code snippets showing how they configured the filter. The issue arises because certain URLs without or with trailing slashes return 404 errors, which shouldn't happen.

The key points here are:
- The problem occurs in UrlHandlerFilter.
- It's about how the filter handles trailing slashes when a context path is specified.
- The user provided code examples and a reproduction project, indicating it's a bug related to this specific component.

Now, considering the label assigned: ""filter."" Since the entire issue revolves around the behavior of UrlHandlerFilter, which is indeed a filter in Spring Framework, the label seems appropriate. It accurately categorizes the problem under issues related to filters.

I don't see any other aspects in the report that would require additional labels like ""bug"" or ""configuration,"" although those might be helpful. But based solely on whether ""filter"" is an accurate reflection, it definitely fits because the core of the issue is about the UrlHandlerFilter's functionality.

microsoft/vscode,202138,bug,Json breaks for large files after roughly 50000 lines,"






Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes



- VS Code Version: 1.86.0-insider (user setup)
- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19045
```The log indicates that the application version is 1.86.0-insider, built on January 9, 2024, with specific details about the Electron, Chromium, Node.js, V8 versions, and operating system (Windows 10, version 19045).```

Steps to Reproduce:

1. load json (?) file with more than 52632 (for one test, the next failed at 49xxx depending on the window-size) lines
2. scroll past line 52632 (or jump to end)

![image](<URL>

![image](<URL>
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Json breaks for large files after roughly 50000 lines."" This suggests that when handling JSON files with a large number of lines (around 50k), something goes wrong. The word ""breaks"" implies that there's an issue or malfunction in the software, which is typically classified as a bug.

Next, the body of the issue. The user provided details about their environment—VS Code version, OS, and other specifics. They mentioned that when loading a JSON file with more than 52632 lines and scrolling past line 52632, something fails. They also included steps to reproduce and images (though I can't see them, but they likely show the problem visually). The fact that they provided detailed reproduction steps further supports this being a bug report since users usually do this when encountering unexpected behavior.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve the issue. There are several code changes across different files. Each patch introduces a new variable called `bigNumbersDelta` and adjusts various calculations by subtracting this delta. The comments mention handling large numbers to prevent issues, specifically noting that IE can't handle very large pixel values, so they reduce the numbers every 500k pixels.

These patches indicate that the problem was related to how vertical offsets were calculated when dealing with large files, leading to incorrect rendering or performance issues. By adjusting these calculations and introducing `bigNumbersDelta`, the developers mitigated the bug where the JSON parser or renderer would break for large files.

Considering all this, the issue is clearly about unexpected behavior in the software (VS Code) when handling large JSON files, which fits the definition of a bug. The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem described and the fixes applied.
</think>

The issue report describes a malfunction in VS Code when handling large JSON files, supported by detailed steps and patches fixing rendering issues. Thus, the label is accurate.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Json breaks for large files after roughly 50000 lines."" This immediately tells me that there's an issue with handling JSON files when they are large—specifically around 50,000 lines. The word ""breaks"" suggests that something is going wrong, like a malfunction or error.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue report. The user provided detailed steps to reproduce the problem: loading a JSON file with over 52632 lines and then scrolling past line 52632 or jumping to the end. They also included images, which likely show what happens when they try to do this—probably some kind of error message or UI malfunction.

The user mentioned that the issue occurs even when all extensions are disabled, which rules out third-party extensions as the cause. This points more towards a problem within VS Code itself rather than an external add-on. They also provided their environment details, such as the version of VS Code they're using (1.86.0-insider), OS version (Windows 10), and other technical specs like Electron and Node.js versions. All this information is helpful for developers to pinpoint where the issue might be occurring.

The steps to reproduce are clear and specific. They outline exactly what actions trigger the problem, which is crucial for debugging. The fact that the issue happens consistently when handling large JSON files suggests it's a bug in how VS Code processes these files, perhaps related to memory handling or parsing limits.

Additionally, the mention of varying failure points depending on window size could indicate that it's not just a simple line count issue but might involve rendering or display logic. Maybe the editor can't handle large files efficiently beyond a certain point, leading to performance issues or crashes.

Given all this information, the label ""bug"" seems appropriate because the report describes an unintended behavior in VS Code when dealing with large JSON files. The user isn't asking for a feature request or discussing functionality; they're highlighting a problem that needs fixing.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at the title of the issue: ""[CI] SearchTemplateRequestTests testConcurrentSerialization failing"". The word ""testConcurrentSerialization"" stands out here. That suggests that the problem is related to concurrent serialization, which typically involves multiple threads accessing shared resources and how they handle serialization.

Looking at the body of the issue, it provides details about build scans and a reproduction line. It mentions that this test is failing with an AssertionError where both expected and actual values are the same, but that's a bit confusing. Maybe there's some race condition causing inconsistent results sometimes.

The failure message shows an assertion error between two ""unset"" values. That might indicate that under concurrent access, some variables aren't being set as expected or are being overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue: 

In Patch 1, several test methods related to SearchTemplateRequestTests and RankEvalRequestTests were removed or modified. The tests include names like ""testConcurrentSerialization"" and similar concurrency-related terms. This suggests that the failures were occurring in these specific test cases which are designed to check concurrent behavior.

Patch 2 modifies code in a way that seems to handle options related to allowSelectors, accessing gatekeeperOptions directly instead of through another method. The comments mention a feature flag being removed, which might be part of a larger change related to concurrency control or how certain features are gated.

Putting it all together: the test failures are specifically in methods testing concurrent serialization and related areas. The patches address these tests and parts of the code that manage concurrency-related flags or options. Therefore, the issue is indeed about concurrency problems in the tests, which would make the label ""concurrency"" accurate.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""[CI] SearchTemplateRequestTests testConcurrentSerialization failing"". The word ""testConcurrentSerialization"" stands out here. That suggests that the test is related to concurrent processes or thread safety. So, the problem might be occurring when multiple things are happening at the same time.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. Under the **Failure Message**, there's an AssertionError where both expected and actual values are ""org.elasticsearch.script.mustache.SearchTemplateRequest/unset"". That doesn't immediately tell me much about concurrency, but it shows that some condition wasn't met during the test.

Looking at the reproduction line, it's a specific test being run: ""testConcurrentSerialization"". This reinforces the idea that concurrency is involved because the test itself is designed to check how the system behaves under concurrent conditions.

The **Issue Reasons** section mentions multiple failures in release-tests and testConcurrentSerialization. It talks about failure rates, which can sometimes be indicative of race conditions or other concurrency-related issues, especially if they happen sporadically rather than consistently.

The presence of multiple build scans also supports that this isn't an isolated incident but something recurring across different builds, which might point to a deeper issue in how the code handles concurrent operations.

Putting it all together: the test name specifically mentions ""ConcurrentSerialization,"" and the failure is happening in that context. The label ""concurrency"" seems appropriate because the problem is occurring during a test designed to check for concurrency issues.

spring-projects/spring-framework,32742,configuration,Ignore non-String keys in `PropertiesPropertySource.getPropertyNames()`,"System.getProperties().put(1,1);

```The log indicates an `AuthenticationException` with the message ""error token"" occurred in a Spring application's dispatcher servlet. The root cause of the exception is an `ArrayStoreException`, which was triggered when attempting to store an `Integer` in a collection that expects a different type. This issue arises from the `toArray` method being called on an `AbstractCollection`, likely due to mismatched types in the underlying data structure.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title, body, and the patches provided.

The title of the issue is ""Ignore non-String keys in `PropertiesPropertySource.getPropertyNames()`"". From that, it seems like the problem has something to do with handling properties where the keys aren't strings. The method in question is getPropertyNames(), which probably retrieves all the property names from a source. So the issue arises when there are keys that aren't Strings, causing some kind of error.

Looking at the body, there's an example code snippet: System.getProperties().put(1,1); which adds an Integer key to the system properties. Then there's a stack trace showing an ArrayStoreException with java.lang.Integer. The exception occurs in org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationException, but digging deeper, it seems related to how Spring's PropertiesPropertySource handles property names.

The error happens when trying to convert a collection to an array, specifically at StringUtils.toStringArray(). It looks like the code was expecting all keys to be Strings, but since there are non-String keys (like Integer 1), it throws this exception because you can't put an Integer into a String array.

Now looking at the patches. The first patch modifies the getPropertyNames() method in PropertiesPropertySource.java. Instead of just calling super.getPropertyNames(), which probably returns all keys including non-Strings, they're now filtering the keySet() to include only String instances and then converting that to a String array. This should prevent any non-String keys from causing issues.

The second patch is a test case in MapPropertySourceTests.java. They create a set of expected keys using System.getProperties().stringPropertyNames(), which only includes String keys, but they add STRING_PROPERTY_NAME manually because it might have a non-String value and was filtered out. Then they assert that the property names from the source match this expected set.

So putting it all together: The issue is about handling configuration properties where some keys aren't Strings, causing runtime exceptions. The fix ensures only String keys are considered in getPropertyNames(), which affects how configurations are loaded and processed.

The label assigned was ""configuration"". Considering that, the problem revolves around system properties and how they're handled by Spring's environment and configuration classes. Configuration issues often relate to how properties are read, stored, and accessed, so this seems relevant.

But wait, is there another possible label like ""bug"" or ""error-handling""? The issue does describe a bug causing an exception, but the fix is specifically about filtering keys in configuration handling. So while it's technically a bug, the main theme is configuration processing.

Therefore, I think the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects this report because it deals with how properties are managed and accessed within the system's configuration.
</think>

The issue revolves around handling non-String keys in property sources, affecting configuration processing. The patches ensure only String keys are considered, fitting under the configuration category.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is: ""Ignore non-String keys in `PropertiesPropertySource.getPropertyNames()`"". That immediately tells me that the problem has something to do with how properties are being handled, specifically when the keys aren't strings. Properties usually refer to configuration settings, so that's a clue.

Looking at the body, there's some code and a stack trace. The user provided an example where they put an integer key into System properties: `System.getProperties().put(1,1);`. Then, there's an error occurring with a root cause of `ArrayStoreException` related to an Integer. This suggests that when trying to process these properties, something went wrong because the key wasn't a String.

The stack trace shows classes like `MapPropertySource`, `PropertiesPropertySource`, and mentions Spring Framework and Netflix's Archaius library. These are all related to configuration management in applications. The error occurs during the retrieval of property names, specifically when non-String keys are involved.

So, putting this together: the issue is about how the application handles properties with non-String keys, leading to an exception. Since properties are a key part of application configuration, and the problem arises within the configuration handling code, the label ""configuration"" seems appropriate here.

I don't see any elements that would suggest another label like ""bug"", ""enhancement"", or something else is more fitting. The core issue revolves around how configuration properties are being processed, which aligns with the ""configuration"" label.
</think>

The label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the issue because it pertains to handling non-String keys in property sources within configuration management.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""lifetime"" accurately reflects the issue report based on its title, body, and patches. Let's start by understanding what each part is about.

The issue report has a title related to type placeholders in item signatures, specifically in Rust. The main problem seems to be that using underscores as placeholders in types within function signatures or other item declarations isn't allowed anymore. 

Looking at the body of the report and the patches, it's clear that several errors are being addressed where `_` is used in various contexts like functions, structs, type aliases, etc. For example, one error message mentions replacing `_` with proper type parameters to fix issues in function signatures.

The patches show changes across multiple files, all related to correcting these placeholder usages. They adjust implementations and item signatures to use generic types instead of underscores. This is about improving the strictness of Rust's type system, preventing the misuse of placeholders where they shouldn't be allowed.

Now, considering the label ""lifetime"": lifetimes in Rust are about managing references' scopes. The issue here isn't directly related to how lifetimes are handled but rather to type placeholder usage. So the changes and errors don't pertain to lifetime management but to general type system enforcement.

Therefore, the label ""lifetime"" doesn't accurately reflect this issue report.
</think>

0",0,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""lifetime"" is appropriate for this bug report. Let's start by looking at what's provided.

The user shared a crash dump from Rust, which shows an internal compiler error (ICE). The backtrace includes various functions and modules like `rustc_span`, `rustc_interface`, `std`, and others. The note at the end suggests filing a bug with labels including ""C-bug"", ""I-ICE"", and ""T-compiler"". The user then assigned the label ""lifetime"" to this report.

Now, I need to determine if ""lifetime"" accurately reflects the issue based on the title and body of the report. Since the crash is an ICE during compilation, it points to a problem within the compiler itself rather than a specific feature like lifetimes. Lifetimes in Rust are about managing references and preventing dangling pointers, but this error seems more about the compiler crashing unexpectedly.

Looking at the backtrace, there's no mention of lifetime-related functions or modules. The error occurs during the compilation process, possibly related to how the compiler handles certain code structures or optimizations. Without specific information tying it to lifetimes, like a message referencing them or a function named after them, it's hard to say this is directly a lifetime issue.

The label ""lifetime"" might be misleading here because the problem isn't clearly about lifetime management but rather an internal compiler failure. Assigning such a label could cause confusion and make it harder for developers to identify the root cause. Instead, labels related to the compiler or ICEs would be more appropriate.

So, considering all this, I don't think ""lifetime"" is the right label here. It doesn't directly reflect the nature of the issue described.
</think>

The label ""lifetime"" does not accurately reflect the issue report, as it pertains to an internal compiler error rather than lifetime management in Rust.

NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra,6782,bug,Tabs in modals fail to focus,"**Describe the bug**
This is an intermittent bug, but I will do my best to explain it. Basically, in several places where there is a TabView (or whatever it is called), it seems Ghidra is unable to focus specific tabs (see reproduction steps for more information).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Perform a search or open a struct in the Structure Editor (both are modals with tabs)
2. Perform another search or open another struct (should add a tab to the modal and focus it)
3. Observe the modal opening, but the new tab not focusing

**Expected behavior**
The search results and/or Structure Editor opens and the newly opened tab is focused

**Screenshots**

**Attachments**

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: macOS 14.6
 - Java Version: 22.0.1
 - Ghidra Version: 11.1.2
 - Ghidra Origin: GitHub releases

**Additional context**
This is intermittent, but I have noticed it enough to where it is frustrating. This was not happening on the version I used previously: 11.0.3.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The issue title is ""Tabs in modals fail to focus."" That clearly points to a problem where tabs aren't getting focus as expected when using modals. The body of the issue describes it as an intermittent bug, which suggests it doesn't happen every time but occurs frequently enough to be frustrating. It provides reproduction steps involving opening searches or structs in the Structure Editor, leading to modals with tabs that should focus on newly opened ones but don't.

The expected behavior is that the new tab gets focused when opened. The environment details include macOS 14.6, Java Version 22.0.1, and Ghidra version 11.1.2 from GitHub releases. This setup helps in identifying potential platform or software-specific issues. Additionally, the user mentions it wasn't a problem in version 11.0.3, indicating this might be a regression.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies code related to `focusComponent` method. It checks for a non-null placeholder and calls `requestFocusWhenReady()` instead of using `Swing.runLater()`. This suggests a change in how focus is requested, possibly addressing timing issues where the component wasn't ready.

Patch 2 renames `requestFocus()` to `requestFocusWhenReady()` and introduces an `ExpiringSwingTimer` to wait before requesting focus. It also includes a method `doRequestFocus` that uses `KeyboardFocusManager` to ensure the window is active before focusing, which seems like it's adding safeguards against focusing when the application isn't ready.

Patch 3 updates the `updateFocus` method to call `requestFocusWhenReady()` directly without using `Swing.runLater()`, aligning with the changes in Patches 1 and 2. It removes redundant checks that were previously done within a Swing-run later block, which might have been causing race conditions.

Patch 4 modifies the `add` method to use `info.requestFocusWhenReady()` instead of `requestFocus()`. This ensures consistency across the codebase in how focus is handled after adding components.

All these patches are aimed at addressing issues where tabs aren't focusing as expected. They seem to refactor how focus is requested, particularly by using a delayed approach to ensure that components are ready and the application is in the correct state before attempting to set focus. This should prevent intermittent failures due to timing issues or unready UI states.

Considering all this, the issue report describes a malfunction in the software (tabs not focusing) which is a bug. The patches provided directly target fixing this behavior by adjusting how focus is managed. Therefore, labeling it as ""bug"" is accurate because it's an unintended defect that causes the software to behave incorrectly.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me read through the problem again.

The title says, ""Tabs in modals fail to focus."" That sounds like something isn't working as it should. The body describes a bug where tabs in modals aren't getting focused when they're opened. They provided steps to reproduce: opening searches or structs in the Structure Editor, which are modals with tabs. When you do another search or open another struct, a new tab is added but doesn't focus.

They also mention the expected behavior is that the new tab should be focused. So this isn't just a feature request; it's about functionality not working as intended. The user has tried to replicate it and provided environment details like OS, Java version, Ghidra version, etc., which are standard for bug reports. They also note that this issue started after updating from 11.0.3 to 11.1.2.

So, putting this together, the report is clearly about an unintended behavior in the software—tabs not focusing when they should. This fits the definition of a bug because it's a problem causing the application to behave unexpectedly.
</think>

The issue describes unexpected behavior where tabs aren't focusing as intended after certain actions, fitting the definition of a bug. The user provided reproduction steps and environment details, typical for bug reports.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""failure"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the issue title: ""[CI] AzureSnapshotRepoTestKitIT class failing"". That clearly indicates a problem with a test class in CI, which relates to test failures. So that's a point towards the label being appropriate.

The body of the issue lists multiple build scans and failure history. It mentions 4 consecutive failures in the specific test class, high fail rates in certain steps, and provides a dashboard link for more details on the failures. This all points to recurring issues causing test failures, which aligns with the ""failure"" label.

Now looking at the patches. Several of them are modifying tasks to disable certain tests when in FIPS mode because they can't override the trust store there. For example, Patch 1 and Patch 9 add conditions to disable managedIdentityYamlRestTest and workloadIdentityJavaRestTest when BuildParams.inFipsJvm is true. Similarly, other patches adjust system properties or conditions based on whether it's FIPS mode. The TODO comments in Patches 2,5,6,7,8,10 mention that the HTTPS fixture should be used once a specific issue is addressed, indicating that currently, these tests are skipped in FIPS to prevent failures.

These changes suggest that the failing tests were causing CI issues, and the solution was to disable them under certain conditions. This directly relates to test failures, which the ""failure"" label represents.

There's no indication that this is a bug or an enhancement request; it's clearly about resolving test failures in the CI pipeline. So all the evidence supports that the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to recurring test failures in the CI environment, supported by both the issue description and the patches applied.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: ""[CI] AzureSnapshotRepoTestKitIT class failing."" This clearly indicates that there's a problem with a specific test class in the CI (Continuous Integration) environment. The word ""failing"" directly points to a failure scenario.

Now, examining the body of the issue report. It lists multiple build scans and provides links to them, which suggests that the failures are occurring across different builds. There's a section on ""Reproduction Line,"" but it's marked as undefined, meaning the exact steps to reproduce might not be known yet.

The applicable branch is main, so this affects the primary development line. The question of whether it reproduces locally is marked as N/A, which implies that the issue is specific to the CI environment rather than being a local setup problem.

Looking at ""Failure History,"" there's a link to a dashboard, indicating that this failure has been tracked over time. The detailed ""Issue Reasons"" section lists multiple points of failure: 4 consecutive failures in the specified test class, high fail rates in certain steps like openjdk17_checkpart2_java-fips-matrix and part-2-fips. These statistics clearly show recurring issues.

The note at the end mentions that this issue was created using new test triage automation, suggesting it's part of a systematic process to identify and report test failures.

Putting all this together: the title explicitly states a class is failing, and the body provides extensive details on multiple instances of these failures across different builds and steps. The assigned label ""failure"" captures the essence of the problem described, as it's about tests failing in CI.
</think>

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue report because both the title and body detail recurring test failures in a specific class within the CI environment.

FuelLabs/sway,6337,panic,Sway compiler crash for access out-of-bound memory in intrinsic function arguments check during semantic analysis,"From <URL>

# Brief/Intro
Sway compiler crash for access out-of-bound memory during arguments check in semantic analysis.

# Vulnerability Details
In type_check_encode_append function of the semantic_analysis/ast_node/expression/intrinsic_function.rs#L239, there's no length check for argument in [1]. When the intrinsic function is defined with improper argument parameters, out-of-bound access happens in [1].
```The code snippet defines a function `type_check_encode_append` that performs type checking and encoding for a specific intrinsic function. It initializes a buffer type, type-checks an expression with this buffer type, and extracts the span of another argument. The function returns a result containing either a tuple of intrinsic function kind and type ID, or an error.```
This leads to the out-of-bound vector access
# Impact Details
Online verification service or sway playground which accept sw contract could be crashed by the malicous sw contract.

# References
[1] <URL>

# Proof of Concept
Compile the following contract using forc build:
```The code snippet defines a library with a struct `Buffer` and a trait `T`. It also provides an implementation of `T` for a fixed-size string slice `str[10]`, which includes a method `a` that returns a new `Buffer` with an encoded buffer value.```
Running it would get the following panic:
`````The log indicates that during compilation, the program encountered a panic in the `intrinsic_function.rs` file at line 239. Specifically, there was an attempt to access an index out of bounds in a list or array with a length of 1, using an index of 1. This resulted in a runtime error.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the title of the issue is about a crash in the Sway compiler due to accessing out-of-bound memory during semantic analysis. The body explains that there's no length check for arguments in a specific function, leading to an index out of bounds error. They provided a proof of concept where compiling certain code causes a panic with an error message about the index being out of bounds.

Looking at the patches, Patch 1 adds a check for the number of arguments before accessing them, which prevents the crash by returning an error instead. Patches 2-6 seem to set up test cases or configurations to reproduce and verify the issue, ensuring that such cases are caught in the future.

The label assigned is ""panic,"" but I'm thinking about whether this captures the essence of the problem. The issue isn't just a panic; it's more about an out-of-bounds memory access causing a crash. However, the term ""panic"" does describe the runtime error that occurs when the index is out of bounds.

So, while ""panic"" is part of the symptom, maybe other labels like ""crash,"" ""memory-safety,"" or ""out-of-bounds"" would be more precise. But since ""panic"" is a relevant and accurate description of what happens (the program crashes due to an error), I think it's acceptable.

I'm leaning towards yes, but I'm not 100% sure if there's a better label. Given the information, though, ""panic"" does fit because that's exactly what the proof of concept shows—a panic due to index out of bounds.
</think>

The label ""panic"" is appropriate as it accurately describes the runtime error causing the crash.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Sway compiler crash for access out-of-bound memory in intrinsic function arguments check during semantic analysis."" The key points here are a crash due to accessing memory out of bounds during semantic analysis. So, the issue is about the compiler crashing because of an array or vector index that's too high.

Now, moving on to the body. The report explains that there's no length check for argument [1] in the function `type_check_encode_append`. When the intrinsic function has improper parameters, this leads to an out-of-bounds access at `[1]`, causing a crash. They even provided code snippets showing where the issue occurs and included a proof of concept with sample code that triggers a panic.

The impact section mentions that online services using Sway could be crashed by malicious contracts. This indicates it's not just a minor bug but something that can cause service disruptions, which is serious.

Looking at the references and proof of concept, when they run the example contract, the compiler panics with an ""index out of bounds"" error because the index 1 doesn't exist in a vector of length 1. This panic is the result of accessing `arguments[1]` without checking if there are enough arguments.

The label assigned was ""panic."" Since the issue leads to a runtime panic due to improper argument handling causing an out-of-bounds access, the term ""panic"" seems appropriate. It accurately describes the symptom and the nature of the crash.

So, yes, the label does reflect the problem described.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41661,bug,mvn spring-boot:build-image fails when 'classifier' is set to non-default value,Forward port of issue #26721 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the title and body of the issue.

The title says: ""mvn spring-boot:build-image fails when 'classifier' is set to non-default value."" That sounds like a problem where using a specific feature (the classifier) causes a failure, which indicates a bug because it shouldn't be failing under normal circumstances.

Looking at the body, it's just forwarding another issue. So not much info there, but the fact that it's being forwarded suggests it was already identified as an issue.

Now, looking at the patches. There are four patches provided. 

Patch 1 modifies some test methods. It looks like they're changing how tests are conducted when a classifier is used without repackaging and when it's used with repackaging. So maybe the tests were failing before because of incorrect behavior when classifiers weren't handled properly.

Patch 2 adds a new Maven project file (pom.xml) for a test case involving a classifier. This suggests they're setting up a scenario to replicate or test the issue, which makes sense if it's a bug that needed specific conditions to be triggered.

Patch 3 adds a Java source file with some code that keeps the application running by waiting on args. This might be part of the setup for testing the build process, ensuring that the image doesn't exit immediately and can be tested properly.

Patch 4 modifies the getArchiveFile method in some class. It changes comments about why project.getArtifact().getFile() isn't used because it's null after a forked lifecycle. Then, in getBackupFile, they adjust how backup files are handled based on classifiers. This seems like fixing logic around file handling when classifiers are non-default.

Putting this together, the problem arises when using a classifier (a Maven feature) which is causing build-image to fail. The patches adjust test cases and file handling logic related to classifiers, indicating that there was an issue in how these were managed before. 

Since the problem causes a failure and the changes fix that behavior, it's reasonable to label this as a bug because it's an unintended behavior that needed correction.
</think>

The issue describes a problem where using a non-default classifier causes `mvn spring-boot:build-image` to fail, which is a bug. The patches address test cases and file handling logic related to classifiers, confirming the fix for incorrect behavior.

1",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break this down step by step. The issue is titled ""mvn spring-boot:build-image fails when 'classifier' is set to non-default value."" From the title alone, it seems like there's a problem with the build process when using a specific configuration (non-default classifier). That points towards a bug because something isn't working as expected.

Looking at the body, it mentions that this is a forward port of issue #26721 to the 3.3.x branch. Forward porting usually implies that the same issue exists in another version or branch and needs to be addressed there. This reinforces the idea that it's an existing problem (bug) being moved rather than a new feature request.

The label assigned is ""bug."" Considering both the title and body, this makes sense because the report describes a specific failure condition during the build process, which fits the definition of a bug—a defect or unintended behavior in the software.
</think>

The issue report's title indicates a problem (failure) when using a non-default classifier with `mvn spring-boot:build-image`, which is characteristic of a bug. The body references forwarding an existing issue (#26721), further suggesting it's a known bug being addressed. Therefore, the ""bug"" label accurately reflects the content.

@rustbot label F-type-alias-impl-trait",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression is in software terms. A regression typically refers to a bug or issue that appears after a change was made to the codebase. It's when something that was previously working correctly stops working as intended, often due to a new feature, fix, or other modification.

Looking at the issue title: ""TAIT: closure and RPIT causes 'concrete type differs from previous defining opaque type use'"". TAIT probably stands for Type Alias Impl Trait. The error message suggests there's a type mismatch happening when using closures with these traits.

The body of the issue describes how replacing `-> impl Sized` with `-> F` in the `fn spawn` function makes it compile. This indicates that before this change, the code wasn't compiling because of the type error. The user also provided a minimized example from another repository, which helps identify where the problem might be occurring.

They included a playground link and some Rust code snippets. Let me look at those:

The first snippet has two functions: `spawn` and `spawn_task`. The `spawn` function is supposed to return an implementation of `Sized`, but in `spawn_task`, when they try to use it with a specific type `Tait`, the compiler throws an error about concrete types differing. The user then bisected the issue, identifying that the problem started on nightly-2024-03-16 and provided the commit hash where the regression occurred.

The patches provided don't seem to fix the issue but rather adjust the code to compile correctly by changing the function signature. So the original issue was causing a compilation error after a certain Rust nightly build, which suggests that something in Rust's compiler changed, introducing this bug.

Given all this, the user is pointing out that after a specific commit in Rust, their code stopped compiling. That fits the definition of a regression because it's an issue introduced by a change in the codebase (Rust's compiler in this case) that previously worked correctly.

Therefore, labeling this as a ""regression"" makes sense because the problem arose from a recent change, and it's not a new feature request or an existing bug that was always there. The bisect information also supports this, showing that the issue started after a specific commit.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title and body.

First, looking at the title: it mentions a specific error related to TAIT and RPIT causing a type mismatch. The body provides more context, including code snippets and an error message. The user also includes a bisect result, pinpointing a specific nightly build where the regression occurred. This indicates that the issue started after a certain commit, which is a hallmark of a regression bug.

The presence of bisected information with specific commits further supports this being a regression. The user used tools to identify exactly when the problem appeared, which is typical in tracking regressions introduced by recent changes. Additionally, the error message points to a concrete type mismatch that wasn't present before, suggesting that something broke after an update.

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""regression"" is appropriate because it clearly shows a problem arising from a change between Rust versions.
</think>

The label ""regression"" accurately reflects the issue report. The bisect information and specific commit identification indicate that the problem was introduced in a recent version of Rust, fitting the definition of a regression.

```This Rust code snippet defines a trait `Trait` with a generic associated type `Gat`. It then declares a function `dyn_hoops` that takes a type implementing `Trait` and returns a pointer to an iterator of dynamically sized types that capture a lifetime. The `typeck` module contains another function `define` that attempts to create an opaque type and assign it the result of calling `dyn_hoops` with `u8` as the argument. The code uses features like `impl Trait` and captures, but the implementation is incomplete and contains an infinite loop.```

",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects the issue described in the given problem. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it's about placeholders not being allowed within types on item signatures for opaque types and other contexts. That suggests a compiler error related to type placeholders, which are underscore-based like `_`.

Next, I'll examine the body of the problem. It provides several code snippets where the placeholder `_` is used in different contexts, such as function return types, struct implementations, type aliases, etc. The compiler errors point out that using `_` in these item signatures isn't allowed and suggests replacing them with actual types or type parameters.

Now, looking at the patches made to resolve this issue. For example, one patch changes `fn impl_trait() -> impl BadTrait<_>` to `fn impl_trait<T>() -> impl BadTrait<T>`. This replaces the placeholder `_` with a type parameter `T`, which is a valid way to handle generics in Rust without using underscores.

Another patch modifies an associated constant from `const C: _;` to `const C: i32;`, replacing the underscore with a specific type, which makes sense because placeholders aren't allowed there either.

So, the problem revolves around incorrect use of `_` as a placeholder in various type contexts where they shouldn't be used. The patches fix these by using proper type annotations or parameters instead.

Now, what does ""unsoundness"" mean in this context? Unsoundness typically refers to situations where a programming language allows constructions that can lead to runtime errors or violate the type system's guarantees. For example, if the compiler allowed incorrect type placeholders, it might cause type safety issues.

In this case, using `_` in type signatures can lead to incorrect type inferences or bypass necessary checks, which could introduce unsoundness. By preventing the use of `_` in these contexts and requiring explicit types or parameters, Rust maintains its strong type system guarantees.

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""unsoundness"" seems appropriate because it deals with enforcing correct type usage to prevent potential violations of type safety.
</think>

1",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""unsoundness"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at what the issue is about.

The title of the issue says: ""ICE: type_alias_impl_trait: `panic in a destructor during cleanup`"". ICE stands for Internal Compiler Error, which means the compiler crashed or panicked while trying to compile the code. The error message also mentions a panic in a destructor during cleanup, which suggests something went wrong during the destruction of some data.

Looking at the body, the user provided a Rust code snippet that's causing the issue. The code uses some advanced features like `type_alias_impl_trait` and involves traits, iterators, and lifetimes. There are compile errors related to undeclared lifetime names and missing trait `Captures`. 

The error output shows two main issues: an undeclared lifetime 'a' and a missing trait `Captures`. However, the compiler didn't just stop at those errors; it also panicked, which is unexpected behavior. The backtrace indicates that during type checking of some opaque types, the compiler hit a panic in the destructor.

Now, considering the labels assigned to Rust issues: ""unsoundness"" typically refers to situations where the compiler allows code that violates Rust's safety guarantees, potentially leading to undefined behavior at runtime. This could include incorrect lifetimes, null pointer dereferences, or other memory-safety issues.

In this case, the issue is an ICE due to a panic during cleanup. While the compile errors point to specific lifetime and trait issues, the fact that the compiler crashes suggests a bug in how it's handling these cases. However, unsoundness would imply that the code could cause runtime errors or memory safety issues if it had compiled. Here, the problem is more about the compiler crashing rather than allowing unsafe code to run.

So, I'm leaning towards this not being an ""unsoundness"" issue because there's no indication that the compiler allowed incorrect code to compile and run unsafely. Instead, it's a crash during compilation, which falls under a different category of bugs, possibly a ""compiler bug"" or ""ICE"".

rust-lang/rust,127849,runtime error,Bootstrap using `set_times` on a read-only file,"@jieyouxu noticed that bootstrap is now failing on a clean Windows build:

```The log indicates that the `main` thread panicked due to an ""Access is denied"" error when attempting to set times on a file using `llvm_config_file.set_times(file_times)`.```

This fails due to the file being opened as read-only:

<URL>

This could be fixed using windows specific permissions but it'd be simpler to just use `OpenOptions` with `write(true)`.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided title, body, and patches.

First, looking at the title: ""Bootstrap using `set_times` on a read-only file."" It mentions an issue during the bootstrap process where a specific function is used on a read-only file. 

In the body of the issue, there's a panic in the main thread due to an OS error 5 (Access Denied) when trying to set times on a file that was opened as read-only. The user suggests using `OpenOptions` with write access to fix it.

The patches provided show that they changed how the file is opened. Instead of using `File::open()`, which by default opens the file in read-only mode, they switched to `File::options().write(true).open()`. This change allows writing to the file, preventing the access denied error when setting times.

Now, considering what a ""runtime error"" means. Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program and prevent it from running as intended. In this case, the issue caused a panic, which is indeed a runtime error because it stops the program's execution. The problem arises dynamically while the code is executing, not at compile time.

Therefore, labeling this as ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately describes the issue because the problem occurred during the execution of the program, causing a panic and stopping its operation. This fits the definition of a runtime error.

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""Bootstrap using `set_times` on a read-only file"". The word ""bootstrap"" here suggests it's about the initialization process of some tool or system, probably Rust in this context since it mentions `download.rs`. The issue is happening when using `set_times`, which I know is related to setting file times like access or modification times. So, the problem arises because they're trying to set these times on a file that's read-only.

Now, looking at the body of the report, there's an error message from the Rust build process on Windows. The panic happens in `download.rs` at line 711, where `llvm_config_file.set_times(file_times)` fails with ""Access is denied."" The OS error code 5 corresponds to Access Denied, which makes sense because the file is read-only.

The user explains that this failure occurs because the file was opened as read-only. They provide a link to the specific lines in Rust's source where this happens. Their suggested fix involves using `OpenOptions` with `write(true)`, which would open the file in write mode instead of read-only.

So, what exactly is happening here? The issue is about a runtime error during the build process because the program doesn't have the necessary permissions to modify the file's times. The error occurs when executing the code, not at compile time or any other phase.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error"". A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs while the program is running, as opposed to compile-time errors which happen during compilation. This issue definitely fits because it's happening during execution when trying to set file times.

But wait, sometimes labels can be more specific than just ""runtime error"". For example, this could also fall under categories like ""file handling"", ""permissions"", or ""Windows-specific issue"". However, the label in question is simply ""runtime error,"" which seems appropriate because it accurately describes that the problem occurs during execution.

I don't see any information suggesting it's a compile-time error or anything else. The error message points to an OS-level permission issue at runtime. So yes, ""runtime error"" captures the essence of the problem.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" is appropriate because the issue occurs during program execution when trying to set file times on a read-only file.

golang/go,66693,bug,x/website: release notes for Go 1.22 mentions inexistent math/rand/v2.Uint(),"### Go version

go version go1.22.2 linux/amd64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```The log output is `N/A`, indicating that no applicable data or information is available.```


### What did you do?

Read release notes at [<URL> highlights are mine:

> The Intn, Int31, Int31n, Int63, and Int64n top-level functions and methods from math/rand are spelled more idiomatically in math/rand/v2: IntN, Int32, Int32N, Int64, and Int64N. **There are also new top-level functions and methods** Uint32, Uint32N, Uint64, Uint64N, **Uint**, and UintN.


### What did you see happen?

Tried to use `math/rand/v2.Uint`, got a compilation error and realized it doesn't exist, and looking at the CLs that added math/rand/v2 it is possible it never existed, even tough it is mentioned in the original proposal.



### What did you expect to see?

Either the release notes are wrong or the new package is missing intended functionality.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""x/website: release notes for Go 1.22 mentions inexistent math/rand/v2.Uint()"". It says that the release notes mention a function that doesn't exist. So the problem here is about incorrect documentation or release notes.

The body of the issue explains that when trying to use `math/rand/v2.Uint()`, there was a compilation error because it doesn't exist. The user checked the CLs and thinks maybe it never existed, even though it's mentioned in the release notes. They expected either the release notes to be wrong or the package missing functionality.

So the main issue is that the documentation incorrectly listed `Uint()` as part of the new functions when it wasn't actually implemented. That's a problem because developers rely on release notes for updates and features.

Now, looking at the patch: it removes the line mentioning `Uint()`, meaning they fixed the documentation by removing the incorrect information. So this was a mistake in the documentation that needed correction.

The question is whether this should be labeled as a ""bug"". A bug usually refers to an issue in the code where something isn't working as intended, causing unexpected behavior or errors. In this case, the issue is about incorrect documentation, not a functional error in the code itself.

However, sometimes inaccuracies in release notes can mislead developers and cause issues, so they might be considered bugs in the documentation. But strictly speaking, it's more of a documentation error rather than a bug in the software.

But looking at how the label was applied: since the patch corrects the release notes by removing a non-existent function, and the problem was that the documentation was wrong, which can confuse users, perhaps the community considers this a bug because it affects user experience and trust in the documentation.

So, I think the label ""bug"" is appropriate here because the incorrect information in the release notes is treated as an issue needing a fix. The patch addresses this by correcting the documentation, so labeling it as a bug makes sense in this context.
</think>

1",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the problem step by step.

The issue's title says: ""x/website: release notes for Go 1.22 mentions inexistent math/rand/v2.Uint()"". So immediately, I can tell that the user is pointing out a discrepancy in the release notes. They noticed something wrong with the documentation or information provided about a specific function in Go version 1.22.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user provides more details. They mention using Go 1.22.2 on Linux and include their environment setup, though it's marked as N/A for `go env`. Then they explain what they did: they read the release notes from the official Go documentation. The link provided points to a specific section where certain functions are mentioned in the math/rand/v2 package.

The user highlights that according to the release notes, there are new top-level functions like Uint32, Uint32N, etc., and specifically mentions ""Uint"" and ""UintN"". However, when they tried to use `math/rand/v2.Uint()`, they encountered a compilation error because it doesn't exist. They also checked the CLs (change lists) that added math/rand/v2 and found that these functions might never have been implemented, even though they were mentioned in the proposal.

So what did they expect? They thought either the release notes are incorrect or the package is missing intended features.

Now, the label assigned here is ""bug"". I need to assess if this is accurate. A bug usually refers to an unintended defect or flaw in the software that causes it to behave incorrectly. In this case, the issue isn't about a bug in the Go code itself but rather in the documentation—specifically, the release notes mentioning functions that don't exist.

So is the label ""bug"" appropriate? Well, if the release notes are part of the broader Go project and they're incorrect or misleading, some might consider this a bug because it's an error in provided information. Alternatively, others might categorize it under ""documentation"" since it's about inaccuracies in the docs rather than the software functioning incorrectly.

But looking at GitHub's common labeling practices, sometimes issues related to documentation errors are labeled as bugs if they affect user understanding or workflow. However, there's also a specific label for documentation issues which might be more accurate here.

Wait, but the user is pointing out that the release notes (which are part of the website) contain incorrect information about functions in a package. The label ""bug"" is assigned under x/website, which suggests it's an issue with the website content. So perhaps in this context, labeling it as a bug makes sense because it's an error on the website (incorrect release notes). Alternatively, maybe it should be labeled as a documentation bug or something similar.

But given that the label provided is simply ""bug"" and not more specific like ""docs"" or ""documentation"", I have to decide if ""bug"" is appropriate here. Since the issue is about incorrect information in the release notes leading to user confusion and errors when trying to use non-existent functions, it's a flaw in the documentation which can be considered a bug in the broader sense of project issues.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" does accurately reflect this issue because it's pointing out an error in the provided documentation that affects users' ability to work with the software correctly.
