golang/go,66626,type system,go/types: add iterator methods,"### Proposal Details

There are many data types in the API of go/types that expose a sequence through a pair of methods `NumFoo() int` and `Foo(int) Foo`. For each of them, we propose to define new convenience methods that are go1.23 push iterators:

```The provided code snippet defines several Go functions that act as iterators for various data structures. Each function takes a `yield` function as an argument and iterates over the elements of the respective data structure, calling `yield` on each element in order to perform some operation. The iterators are used to traverse interfaces, named types, scopes, structs, tuples, method sets, unions, type parameter lists, and type lists. Examples of usage are provided for each iterator.```

Fortunately, the most natural name (usually the plural) was available in all cases.

@findleyr @gri @mdempsky ",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, let me read through the issue details. The title is ""go/types: add iterator methods"". The body proposes adding several iterator methods to various types in the go/types package. These iterators are meant to simplify looping over sequences like methods, fields, etc., using Go 1.23's iterator support. The examples provided show how these new methods can replace manual loops with for-range statements.

Looking at the patches:

Patch 1 adds new method declarations using an iterator interface from the iter package. Each line represents a new method added to different structs like Interface, MethodSet, etc., each returning an iterator sequence of specific types.

Patch 2 is a documentation change, explaining how these new methods can simplify code by replacing manual indexing with iterators. It lists all the new methods and provides examples of their usage.

Patch 3 modifies existing code to use one of the new Methods() iterators instead of a manual loop, demonstrating the practical application of these changes.

Patch 4 is the actual implementation of all these iterator methods. Each function takes a yield function and iterates over the sequence using the existing Len() and At() methods, yielding each element until the yield returns false or the end is reached.

Now, considering the label ""type system"": The type system in Go refers to how types are defined, their structures, and operations allowed on them. The changes here add iterator methods to various type structs in the go/types package, which is part of Go's standard library for handling type information, especially in tools and analyses.

The new methods don't introduce new types or change existing type definitions but rather provide a more convenient way to iterate over collections associated with these types. This enhances the API around type information without altering the fundamental type system itself.

However, since these changes are within the go/types package, which is integral to Go's type system infrastructure, the label ""type system"" could be considered appropriate because it relates to how types and their related data structures are accessed and manipulated.

Alternatively, another possible label might be ""api change"" or ""feature enhancement,"" but given that the issue involves adding methods to structs in go/types, which is part of the type system, ""type system"" seems fitting.

Therefore, I conclude that the label accurately reflects the issue.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Have config/env option to disable all PT2 caching."" This clearly mentions caching, specifically about adding a configuration or environment option to turn off all PT2 caching. So the title is directly related to caching mechanisms.

Now, the body of the issue explains that they want to create a config or env option to disable PT2 caching. They also provided an internal reference link, but since I can't access it, I'll focus on what's here. The body doesn't add much beyond the title but reinforces that the feature is about controlling caching behavior.

Looking at the patches made:

Patch 1 adds a new configuration option called ""force_disable_caches"" to the inductor meta settings. This seems like it's adding the actual toggle they wanted.

Patch 2 modifies some functions to check this new config option. It wraps a function with a decorator that uses ""with_fresh_cache_if_config,"" which probably resets the cache when the option is enabled. So, this patch ensures that when the new option is set, caching is bypassed as intended.

Patch 3 introduces an environment variable ""TORCHINDUCTOR_FORCE_DISABLE_CACHES"" which sets the ""force_disable_caches"" flag. This allows users to enable or disable caching via an environment setting, aligning with the issue's request for a config/env option.

Patch 4 adjusts the logic in the autotune function so that it only attempts to load cached configurations if ""force_disable_caches"" is not set. This means that when caching is disabled, it skips loading from the cache, which makes sense as part of disabling all caching.

Putting this all together: The issue is about adding a way to disable caching, and all the patches are implementing this feature by adding config options, environment variables, and modifying the code to respect these settings. Therefore, the label ""cache"" perfectly encapsulates what the issue is addressing—modifying how caching behaves in the system.

I don't see any aspects of the issue or the patches that would fall outside the scope of caching. Everything here revolves around controlling and managing cache behavior.
</think>

The label ""cache"" accurately reflects the issue, which focuses on adding a configuration option to disable caching. All changes are related to caching mechanisms.

php/php-src,13988,memory leak,Storing DOMElement consume 4 times more memory in PHP 8.1 than in PHP 8.0,"### Description

My application uses `DOMElement` to work on large XML files and manipulates them extensively. I observed a significant increase in peak memory usage between PHP 8.0 and PHP 8.1 while running the same code base, despite performing the same number of operations (200k `DOMElement::setAttribute` calls).

Peak memory usage increased from 30MB in PHP 8.0 to 100MB in PHP 8.1, despite similar operations being performed.
The issue persists across multiple PHP minor versions from PHP 7.4.33 to PHP 8.3.6.

I attempted to reproduce the issue in a minimal code snippet and observed that stored `DOMElement` objects consume increasingly more memory with each PHP version.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""memory leak"" correctly reflects the given issue report. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The issue has a title and body, but they aren't shown here. However, there are patches provided in the context, labeled as Patch 6 and Patch 7, along with some test cases. The patches seem to modify PHP files related to DOMDocument and XPath classes.

Looking at the code changes, I see that several properties in these classes have been marked as @virtual. For example, in the DOMText class, the ""wholeText"" property is made virtual. Similarly, in other classes like DocumentFragment, various properties are being set to virtual.

In PHP, when a property is declared with the @virtual annotation, it typically means that it's being overridden or extended in a child class. This can sometimes relate to how objects handle their state and memory, especially if these properties were previously causing issues with serialization or memory management.

The test cases provided in Patch 6 and 7 show var_dump outputs of DOMText and DOMElement objects. The key change is that the object hashes are now represented with %d instead of fixed numbers (like #7). This suggests that each instance's hash might be unique, which can help prevent issues where multiple instances share the same identifier, potentially leading to memory leaks if not handled correctly.

Additionally, in Patch 6 and 7, certain properties like ""schemaTypeInfo"" are either added or made optional. These changes could be addressing how objects retain their data, ensuring that unnecessary references aren't held longer than needed, which is a common cause of memory leaks.

Putting this together, the patches seem to address issues where DOMDocument objects might not have been garbage collected properly due to incorrect handling of their properties. By making certain properties virtual and adjusting object identification in dumps, it likely fixes scenarios where objects were retaining memory longer than necessary, thus preventing memory leaks.

Therefore, yes, the label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects this issue because the changes are aimed at correcting how objects manage their state and prevent unnecessary memory retention.
</think>

The patches address issues related to DOMDocument object properties and serialization, which can cause memory leaks. The changes aim to fix these by correctly handling virtual properties and object identification.

### What did you expect to see?

compile ok",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""cmd/link: runtime.mach_vm_region_trampoline: unsupported dynamic relocation for symbol libc_mach_task_self_ (type=29 (R_GOTPCREL) stype=46 (SDYNIMPORT))"". This seems to be a linker error related to a dynamic relocation. The mention of R_GOTPCREL and SDYNIMPORT suggests it's about how symbols are being handled during linking, possibly in a dynamic context.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. The user is trying to compile a plugin using Go. They mention that when they include a specific import (""myprog/model""), the build fails with the error shown in the title. Without that import, it works fine. It's also noted that this happens on macOS (darwin/amd64), but not on other platforms like Linux or ARM-based macOS.

The user provided the Go version and environment details, which helps identify the context but doesn't directly point to the cause. The key part is the build command using -buildmode=plugin, which clearly indicates they're building a Go plugin.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

1. Patch 1 adds a test case named TestIssue67976, which specifically tests building a plugin using runtime/pprof on darwin/amd64. This suggests that the problem was related to plugins and dynamic imports in the build process for macOS AMD64 systems.

2. Patch 2 creates a new file with a minimal example that reproduces the issue. It uses the runtime/pprof package, which is known to involve certain dynamic imports or profiling features that might trigger linker issues when building plugins.

3. Patch 3 modifies the linker's handling of R_GOTPCREL relocations. This change seems to allow external linking for such relocations in specific build modes (plugin or shared), which aligns with the problem the user encountered while building a plugin.

Putting it all together, the issue revolves around building a Go plugin on macOS AMD64, where including certain imports causes a linker error due to unsupported dynamic relocations. The patches address this by adjusting how the linker handles these specific relocation types in plugin build modes.

The label assigned was ""plugin"". Considering that the problem occurs specifically when building a plugin and the patches are related to plugin build handling, this label seems appropriate. It accurately captures the context of the issue being tied to Go's plugin functionality.

Additionally, the Svelte package version is 5.0.0-next.243.```


### Severity

annoyance",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Svelte 5: `$host()` assignment statement will be removed after compilation"". The title suggests that when someone uses `$host()` and assigns it to a variable, that line of code disappears after compiling. That definitely sounds like unexpected behavior, which is typically considered a bug.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. It describes how assigning `$host()` to a variable results in the assignment statement being removed during compilation. The user provided a reproduction case with code examples. In their example, the compiled JavaScript is missing the `var element = $$props.$$host` line, which means the variable isn't being assigned as intended. This leads to issues because the rest of the code relies on that variable.

They also included system info showing they're using Svelte 5.0.0-next.243, so it's related to a specific version, which is relevant for bug tracking.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a fix message about ensuring `$host` rune compiles correctly in variable declarations. That implies that the issue was fixed by modifying how Svelte handles `$host()` when it's assigned to variables.

Patches 2 and 4 show changes in the code where `$host` is added to lists of runes, likely ensuring they're treated properly during compilation. This prevents their removal.

Patch 3 updates a test case, adding more buttons and events, which suggests testing the fix thoroughly.

All these patches are directly addressing the issue described: the incorrect removal of `$host()` assignments. They ensure that variable declarations using `$host()` aren't dropped during compilation, thus fixing the bug.

Since the problem was an unintended behavior in the code compilation process, and it's been addressed with specific fixes, labeling this as a ""bug"" is accurate. It wasn't a feature request or anything else—it was a clear issue causing incorrect functionality.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it describes unexpected behavior fixed by patches.

- `jl_options` show various configuration settings, including the number of thread pools and threads being set to 0 or default values.

These observations highlight potential issues with the GC configuration and thread management in the Julia environment.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the issue described in the provided context. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue isn't directly provided, but the patches and the problem they address suggest it's related to garbage collection (GC) and thread safety. The patches modify various parts of the code related to GC states, atomic operations, and thread management.

The body of the issue includes multiple patches that change how the GC state is managed. For example, in Patch 2, a new constant JL_GC_STATE_UNSAFE is defined, replacing the previous 0 value. This indicates a refactoring of how GC safety is tracked across threads. Other patches adjust where and when this state is set or checked, such as in functions related to thread initialization, suspension, and task management.

The problem seems to be about ensuring that threads correctly transition between safe and unsafe states during GC operations. If these transitions aren't handled properly, it could lead to race conditions or inconsistent states, which might cause crashes when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization.

Looking at the patches more closely:

1. Patch 2 defines JL_GC_STATE_UNSAFE as 0 and updates functions that set or check the GC state.
2. Patches 4 and 5 adjust assertions and function calls to use this new constant, ensuring consistency.
3. Patches 6 and 7 change initializations of thread TLS (Thread-Local Storage) to use the new state constant.

These changes prevent scenarios where a thread might incorrectly be considered safe when it's actually in an unsafe state, which could lead to concurrent modification issues and subsequent crashes. The modifications ensure that all parts of the code correctly handle GC states, thus preventing potential crashes due to race conditions or improper state management.

Since the patches address issues related to thread safety during GC, which if not fixed could cause the program to crash, the label ""crash"" is appropriate. It reflects the problem's nature accurately because incorrect GC state handling can lead to runtime errors and application crashes.
</think>

The patches address potential race conditions in garbage collection and thread safety that could lead to crashes. The label ""crash"" accurately reflects these issues.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""extension"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, let's look at the issue title: ""Add superhtml and ziggy filetype."" This suggests that the user is requesting support for new file types in Neovim. The body explains that they're working on adding these filetypes and want to use specific extensions (.shtml, .ziggy, .ziggy-schema). They mention being willing to do the work but are opening the issue for discussion.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds autocommands for *.ziggy and *.ziggy-schema, setting their filetypes to ziggy and ziggy_schema respectively. It also comments about adding these file types.

Patch 2 updates a dictionary that maps filetypes to their respective filename checks. It includes entries for ziggy and ziggy_schema with their corresponding file extensions.

Patch 3 seems to include the patch number in an array, indicating it's part of the changes made.

The label assigned is ""extension."" I'm trying to think about what this label typically represents. Often, ""extension"" refers to adding new features or functionalities beyond the core product, like extending Neovim with support for new filetypes.

In this case, the issue is about adding support for superhtml and ziggy filetypes by recognizing their extensions. This fits well under an ""extension"" label because it's expanding Neovim's capabilities to handle more file types, which is a form of extending its functionality.

I don't see any information suggesting that the changes are bug fixes or related to other labels like ""bug,"" ""enhancement,"" or ""discussion."" The focus is on adding new supported extensions, so ""extension"" seems appropriate.

The label ""extension"" accurately reflects the issue as it's about adding support for new filetypes through their extensions.

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the issue report carefully. The title says that compiling std::atomic with thread sanitizer causes broken LLVM emission. So right away, it's about using atomic operations and the thread sanitizer causing a problem.

Looking at the body, the user provided a command they ran which includes RUSTFLAGS for the thread sanitizer. They tried a simple Rust program using AtomicUsize and encountered an error during compilation. The error message mentions ""Broken function found"" in functions related to atomic_swap. 

The backtrace shows multiple instances of ""ZExt only operates on integer"", pointing to specific lines where pointer %1 is being extended to i64. It seems like the compiler is trying to perform a zero extension operation on a pointer, which isn't valid because ZExt expects an integer type.

Now, looking at the patch that fixed this issue. The patch updates a subproject commit in the LLVM project. Specifically, it changes the commit from 84f190a4 to 0af6c732ec. I need to figure out what this change does. Since I can't look up the actual commits, I have to infer based on context.

The issue is happening when using the thread sanitizer and atomic operations. Thread sanitizers are tools that detect data races in concurrent programs. Atomic operations are a fundamental part of concurrency to prevent such races. The error occurs during compilation, specifically when emitting LLVM code for these atomic functions. 

So, this bug seems related to how the compiler handles atomic operations under the thread sanitizer. The fix is likely an adjustment in the way atomic primitives are compiled into LLVM IR, preventing invalid ZExt operations on pointers.

The label ""concurrency"" fits here because it's about issues arising from using concurrent programming constructs (atomics) with a tool meant for concurrency debugging (thread sanitizer). Even though the error is during compilation, the root cause ties back to concurrency-related features and tools.

Therefore, assigning the ""concurrency"" label accurately reflects the nature of this issue. It's not just a general compiler bug but specifically related to how concurrent code is handled.
</think>

The issue revolves around problems with atomic operations when using the thread sanitizer, which are both elements of concurrent programming. The fix addresses how these operations are compiled into LLVM IR, confirming that the label ""concurrency"" accurately captures the problem's context.

This suggests that something about the way Vercel handles caching or routing for SSG pages is causing the problem.

The environment information includes details like Node version, Next.js version (14.1.0), and other relevant packages. It also mentions that the areas affected are App Router and Data fetching (which relates to SSG/SSP). The stages affected are specifically during deployment on Vercel.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 talks about fixing a missing app route with mixed SSR/SSG dynamic routes. This indicates that the issue might be related to how Next.js handles different rendering strategies (like mixing Server-Side Rendering and Static Generation) for certain routes.

Patch 2 modifies serverBuild function by adding checks before pruning prerendered routes, specifically when dealing with app routes in the manifest. This suggests it's about ensuring that dynamic routes which mix SSG and SSR are handled correctly during build time to prevent incorrect route pruning.

Patches 3 adds a page with generateStaticParams, which seems to create static paths for some slugs but bails to server-side rendering (SSR) for 'third'. This might be testing how Next.js handles mixed static and SSR content within the same dynamic route.

Patch 4 updates probes to check if certain paths return 200 with expected content. This is likely adding tests to ensure that after the fix, all these routes work as intended.

Patch 5 increases the expected number of lambdas from 5 to 7. Since Vercel uses serverless functions (lambdas) for Next.js deployments, this change might be ensuring that the correct number of lambda functions are generated when mixing SSR and SSG, preventing some lambdas from being mistakenly pruned.

Putting it all together, the issue seems related to how Next.js on Vercel handles mixed rendering strategies (SSG and SSR) within dynamic routes. The problem arises during deployment where certain pages return 404 instead of rendering correctly because of incorrect pruning or handling of app routes that mix these strategies.

The label assigned is ""cache"". But from what I understand, the issue isn't directly about caching in terms of how data is fetched (like using `getStaticProps` with a cache) but more about how Next.js and Vercel handle different rendering methods for dynamic routes during deployment. The use of `cache: no-store` in the fetch might be part of the problem, but the core issue seems to revolve around route handling and deployment rather than caching mechanisms.

Therefore, labeling it as ""cache"" doesn't capture the essence of the problem, which is more about routing and rendering strategies in a serverless environment. A better label might be something like ""routing"" or ""deployment"" since those are the areas where the issue manifests.
</think>

The label assigned was ""cache,"" but upon analysis, the core issue relates to routing and deployment handling rather than caching mechanisms.

rust-lang/rust,124685,bug,False positives from invalid_reference_casting,"```The code snippet defines a Rust function `apply_mask` that takes a mutable reference to a slice of `u8` bytes, an `usize` offset, and a `u64` mask. It applies the bitwise OR operation between the 8 bytes starting at the given offset and the provided mask. The function ensures the offset plus eight does not exceed the array length before performing the operation. It uses pointer arithmetic and `unsafe` block to perform the bitwise operation on the underlying `u64` value.```

Starting with rustc 1.78.0 (because of #118983) this produces the following

Perhaps I'm missing something but this is not undefined behavior as far as I can tell. The lint is wrong about the backing allocation and I suspect the false warning is downstream from that?",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""False positives from invalid_reference_casting"". This suggests that the reporter is encountering a situation where the Rust compiler is incorrectly flagging some code as having undefined behavior when it's actually not. So, they're getting false positive warnings or errors from the tool.

The body of the issue provides a Rust code snippet that triggers this problem. The user writes a function that manipulates an array using pointers and casts. They mention that starting with rustc 1.78.0 (due to another issue #118983), the compiler produces an error about undefined behavior related to casting references to a bigger memory layout than the backing allocation.

The user argues that this isn't actually undefined behavior, implying that the compiler's warning is incorrect. They suspect the false warning might be due to a mistake in how the lint determines the backing allocation.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies the `is_cast_to_bigger_memory_layout` function. It adds a check for expressions of kind `ExprKind::Index`, and if so, returns None. This means that when dealing with indexed expressions (like array accesses), the code won't attempt to determine the allocation, thus avoiding the false positive.

Patch 2 seems to add a test case. The unsafe function `slice_index` is created within the `bigger_layout()` module, which includes similar code to what the user reported: taking a slice, indexing it, and casting pointers to u64. This serves as a regression test to ensure that the issue doesn't resurface after the fix.

So, the patches are fixing the compiler's handling of indexed expressions in reference casts. The original problem was a false positive where the compiler incorrectly flagged valid code as having undefined behavior because it couldn't correctly trace the allocation when using array indexing.

The label assigned is ""bug"". I think this makes sense because the issue is about incorrect compiler behavior (a bug) causing false positives, and the patches fix that by adjusting how the backing allocation is determined in such cases. So, yes, the label accurately reflects the problem.

Alright, let's break down whether the label ""missing"" is accurate for this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the title: it says there's missing version info for `TextEncoder.prototype.encodeInto()`. That suggests that some information wasn't included where it should be, so the label seems to fit here.

Next, the body of the issue explains that the method was shipped in v12.11.0 but wasn't documented properly. It also mentions a version mismatch with `TextDecoder` and points out incorrect documentation. This reinforces that something (version info) is indeed missing or incorrect in the documentation.

Now, looking at the patches applied. The first patch adds a YAML comment specifying `added: v12.11.0`. This directly addresses the missing version information by adding it where it was lacking. So the fix confirms that the issue was about missing data.

Putting it all together: the title points out missing info, the body details what's wrong with the documentation, and the patch adds the missing version. The label ""missing"" encapsulates all these aspects accurately.
</think>

The label ""missing"" correctly reflects the issue as it addresses the absence of version information in the documentation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""non local definitions"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Unbound local in inductor with inplace foreach and views."" This suggests that there's an unbound local variable somewhere in the code related to the inductor when using inplace foreach operations with multiple views. Unbound locals usually mean a variable is referenced before it's assigned, which can cause errors.

Next, the body of the issue provides more context. It mentions that calling an inplace foreach op with multiple views in the first input list causes Inductor to generate bad code. There's also a link to a gist, but I can't access it, so I'll focus on what's provided here. The versions and people mentioned aren't directly relevant to the label assessment.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue. Patch 1 adds a test case for aliasing in the foreach_add function. It creates several inputs with views and checks if the compiled code matches the eager execution. This suggests they're ensuring that when multiple views (which are different tensors but share data) are used in foreach operations, the generated code doesn't have issues.

Patch 2 seems to modify functions related to pruning redundant dependencies in fused nodes. It introduces a new function _prune_redundant_deps and updates prune_redundant_deps methods in FusedSchedulerNode and SchedulerNode classes. The comments mention weak dependencies and ensuring fusions happen in the correct order, which relates to how nodes are managed during fusion.

The original label assigned is ""non local definitions."" But looking at the patches, especially Patch 2, it's about managing dependencies between nodes during fusion. It seems the problem was that certain dependencies were being kept when they should have been pruned, leading to incorrect ordering or references. This might cause variables to be referenced incorrectly, hence the unbound local error mentioned in the title.

However, ""non local definitions"" usually refers to using variables outside their scope without proper declaration. The issue here seems more about dependency management and correct variable scoping during code generation in Inductor. So while the symptoms (unbound locals) might relate to variable usage, the root cause is about how dependencies are handled after fusing nodes.

Therefore, the label ""non local definitions"" doesn't accurately capture the essence of the problem because it's more about dependency pruning and fusion order rather than non-local variables.
</think>

The patches address issues with dependency management during node fusion, not non-local variable usage. The unbound local error was a symptom of incorrect dependencies.

Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

So, looking at the title: it mentions a StackOverflowError when deploying to Tomcat with Log4j2 configured in a certain way. StackOverflowError is definitely a runtime issue because it happens during execution, not at compile time or build time.

The body of the issue says it's a forward port of another issue, which suggests that this problem was already identified and addressed in a previous version and now needs to be fixed again in the 3.3.x branch. That doesn't add much new info but confirms it's about an existing bug.

Now looking at the patches provided: The changes replace a custom anonymous Filter implementation with DenyAllFilter.newBuilder().build();. This suggests that there was some problem with the original filter causing a StackOverflowError, perhaps due to infinite recursion or excessive resource usage. By switching to a built-in filter, they might be avoiding that issue.

So the problem is about an error occurring when the application runs (deploying to Tomcat), which fits the definition of a runtime error. The label ""runtime error"" accurately captures this because it's an exception that occurs during execution, not something related to build issues, configuration errors, or other types of problems.

I don't see any indication that this is, say, a bug in the codebase (which could be labeled as ""bug"") but more specifically about an error happening at runtime. So yes, the label seems appropriate.
</think>

The issue describes a StackOverflowError during deployment, which occurs at runtime. The patches address this by replacing problematic code with a built-in solution to prevent such errors. Thus, the label accurately reflects a runtime error.

See `go doc internal/godebug` for details. 

Note that to be a useful metric, IncNonDefault has to be called _only_ when the result is actually different, not just when new code is executing that does the same thing old code would have done for a given input. That means checking the input and understanding when a deviation is happening.

This means that

	if winsymlink.Value() == ""0"" {
		return fs.modePreGo1_23()
	}

is not a viable implementation strategy on its own. However, one possibility is to rename the current Mode to mode and then do

	func (fs *fileStat) Mode() FileMode {
		m := fs.mode()
		if winsymlink.Value() == ""0"" {
			old := fs.modePreGo1_23()
			if old != m {
				winsymlink.IncNonDefault()
				m = old
			}
		}
		return m
	}

/cc @qmuntal",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report.

First, looking at the issue title: ""os: winsymlink and winreadlinkvolume missing IncNonDefault calls."" This suggests that certain functions aren't calling a necessary method related to debugging metrics. The body explains that without these calls, the program can't accurately track when behaviors deviate from defaults, which is important for monitoring non-default executions.

The patches provided show several changes. Patch 1 modifies the visibility of the flags by removing ""Opaque: true,"" making them visible in the metrics. Patches 2 and 3 introduce IncNonDefault calls where they were missing. Specifically, after checking if the value is not default, these functions now increment the non-default behavior counters. Additionally, new documentation entries are added in Patch 4 to describe these metrics.

Considering all this, the issue was about a missing functionality (IncNonDefault calls) which led to incorrect tracking of non-default behaviors. The changes fix this omission, which implies that the original code had a bug—specifically, not correctly implementing required functionality for debugging purposes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it addresses missing functionality leading to incorrect behavior.

```The code snippet shows a diff for the `split_module.py` file in the `torch/fx/passes` directory. It adds a conditional block that checks if `keep_original_order` is true and `base_mod_env` is empty.

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let's break down the information provided.

The issue title is ""[fx] split_module fails with no-op graph and keep_original_order=True"". This suggests that when using the `split_module` function with a no-op (no operation) graph and setting `keep_original_order=True`, it fails.

Looking at the body, the user provides code that triggers an error. They import necessary modules, create a function `fn`, trace it into a graph, and then call `split_module`. The problem occurs specifically when `keep_original_order` is set to True, leading to a KeyError: 'x_1'.

The error traceback shows that during execution of `split_module`, there's an attempt to access a key 'x_1' in a dictionary (`base_mod_env`) which doesn't exist. This indicates a runtime issue where the code crashes due to missing data.

The patches provided aim to fix this by adding checks and initializations when `keep_original_order` is True and certain conditions are met (like an empty `base_mod_env`). These changes ensure that necessary variables are populated before they're accessed, preventing the KeyError.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error"": this term refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, as opposed to compile-time or syntax errors. The issue here is exactly that—a crash happening when the code runs under specific conditions. Therefore, the label accurately captures the nature of the problem.

The label ""runtime error"" is appropriate because the issue occurs during execution and results in an error.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""performance"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patch.

First, looking at the title: ""The max QPS of table creation by Lightning is slow & information_schema.tables getting slower causes lightning dispatch schema jobs slower in millions tables scenario."" This clearly mentions that the QPS (queries per second) for creating tables is slow. It also talks about the performance when dealing with a large number of schemas and tables, so it's related to how fast operations are being executed.

Next, the body describes a bug report where importing with 500k schemas and 1 million tables using Lightning is causing issues. The user provided a TiDB version, which indicates they're experiencing this problem in a specific context. The problem seems to be about efficiency when handling millions of tables, which again points towards performance issues.

Looking at the patch that resolved the issue: It modifies the concurrency setting for region operations. Previously, it was taking the minimum of the configured concurrency and 8, but now it's using the maximum between twice the concurrency configuration and 4. This change is aimed at increasing throughput by adjusting how many concurrent connections are used. By ensuring a higher minimum concurrency, the system can handle more operations simultaneously, which directly impacts performance.

So, putting this all together: The issue was about slow QPS and performance degradation with large-scale data, and the patch increases concurrency to improve speed. Therefore, labeling it as ""performance"" is appropriate because it's addressing how efficiently the system handles these operations.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""cmd/compile: failed 'no write barrier' check compiling 'runtime' in TestAbstractOriginSanity"". The title mentions cmd/compile, which I know is part of Go's compiler command. So that suggests it's related to the compiler.

The body of the issue says that changes to runtime.throw caused a linker test using stronger inlining to fail the write barrier static reachability check. This indicates there's an issue with how the code is compiled or optimized, possibly involving the compiler's handling of certain checks or optimizations.

Now looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies the error message in the nowritebarrierrecChecker, adding a comment explaining that a function marked as nowritebarrierrec was found to call another function that involves a write barrier. This seems to be related to the compiler's analysis or checking during compilation.

Patch 2 changes the functions throw and fatal in the runtime package. They replace printpanicval(s) with printindented(s), which is noted to avoid a convTstring write barrier. So this patch is about modifying the runtime code to prevent triggering a write barrier issue, likely because of how the compiler optimizes or inlines functions.

Wait, but if the problem was caused by changes in the runtime package and fixed by modifying those functions, does that mean it's a runtime issue rather than a compiler issue? The initial failure is during compilation when the check fails. So the root cause seems to be in the code being compiled (runtime), but the detection of the issue happens during compilation.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". Since the problem arises from the compile step failing a check, and the fix involves modifying how functions are compiled or analyzed by the compiler (like inlining decisions), it makes sense that the issue relates to the compiler's behavior. The changes in Patch 1 are within the compiler code, adding comments about the error, which suggests they're improving the compiler's handling of such cases.

So even though some patches are in the runtime package, the issue is primarily about the compiler's checks and how it processes the code. Therefore, labeling it as ""compiler"" seems appropriate because the problem occurs during compilation and involves the compiler's static analysis.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on the provided context. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it just says ""[TurboModule] Add support for enums"". That doesn't immediately scream runtime error, but it's about adding functionality related to TurboModule and enums. So maybe it's a feature addition or a bug fix.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. It contains several patches that were made to resolve the problem. Let me examine these patches to understand what they're doing.

The first patch modifies some C++ files, adding methods related to `getStatusLowerCase` and changing the number of parameters in `getStateType`. This suggests that new functionality is being added to handle enums more effectively, perhaps ensuring that enum cases are correctly converted or accessed in JavaScript.

Patch 6 seems to be Objective-C code. It adds a method `lowerCase()` and modifies the `getStateType` method to include an additional parameter `d:(NSString *)d`. This indicates that the interface is being expanded to include new functionality, possibly related to string representations of enums.

In Patch 7, there's a JavaScript file where a function `generateEnum` is modified. The change involves using `toSafeCppString(member.name)` instead of just `member.name`, which suggests an effort to ensure that enum member names are correctly sanitized or converted for C++ compatibility. This could prevent runtime issues if the original strings had characters unsafe for C++ identifiers.

Looking at Patch 5, it adds a new method in Objective-C and modifies the way methods are invoked in the host functions. Specifically, `getStatusLowerCase` is added with its own selector, and `getStateType` now expects an additional argument. This could mean that without these changes, calling these methods might have led to runtime errors due to incorrect parameter counts or missing methods.

The mention of ""runtime error"" as a label suggests that the original issue was causing some kind of crash or unexpected behavior during execution. The patches seem aimed at correctly implementing enum support to prevent such issues. For example, if `getStateType` was expecting 4 parameters but only received 3 before, it might have caused a runtime error due to parameter mismatch.

Additionally, the change in how enum members are named (using `toSafeCppString`) could prevent issues where invalid characters in enum names cause build or runtime errors when used in C++ code.

Putting this together: The patches address adding proper support for enums, ensuring correct method signatures, and safely handling string conversions. These changes likely fix scenarios that would have caused runtime errors before, such as incorrect method calls or invalid parameter counts.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" seems appropriate because the issue was probably causing crashes or unexpected behavior at runtime, which these patches resolve by correcting method implementations and ensuring safe conversions.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue report. The patches address issues that would cause runtime errors, such as incorrect method calls and parameter mismatches.

The applicable branch is main, which indicates it's a current problem in their primary codebase.

The failure message given is an IllegalStateException: ""Found 1 problem"" with details about incorrect optimization due to missing references. This suggests that there's a bug causing the test to fail because of some incorrect behavior or missing data during execution.

Looking at the issue reasons, it mentions multiple consecutive failures in different steps and pipelines, which reinforces that this isn't an isolated incident but a recurring problem. The failure rate percentages are provided as well, showing that while not extremely high, they're significant enough to warrant attention.

Now, examining the patches applied to resolve the issue. Patch 1 removes the test from being skipped or ignored by modifying the tests configuration file. This suggests that the test was failing and might have been disabled until the fix was implemented. Patch 2 adds some code changes related to the PlanConsistencyChecker class, specifically handling cases where EnrichExec with REMOTE mode is present. It looks like they added a check to skip certain validations when dealing with remote enrich operations, which probably prevents the IllegalStateException from occurring.

So putting this together: The issue was about a failing test in CI, caused by incorrect plan optimization leading to an exception. The patches fixed this by modifying how the consistency checker handles remote enrich operations and ensuring the test isn't disabled anymore.

The label ""failure"" is assigned here, which makes sense because it's about a test failure causing CI issues. However, I wonder if there are more specific labels that could be used, like ""bug"" or ""test-failure."" But given the options, ""failure"" does accurately describe the problem as it relates to the test failing and the resulting exception.

I don't see any information that would contradict the use of this label. The issue is clearly about a failure occurring in their CI pipeline due to a specific test case. Therefore, the label ""failure"" seems appropriate here.

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to a failing test in the CI environment with provided details and patches addressing the problem.

golang/go,66218,import,cmd/go: list confuses imports,"go list std cmd should show information about the standard math/rand package, but it seems to only show information for math/rand compiled for cmd/compile, or at least with dependencies compiled for cmd/compile.

This bug appears to have been introduced between Go 1.20 and Go 1.21.0. I have not bisected further.

```The log shows the directory paths and import paths for files related to the `math/rand` package in the Go standard library. The `math/rand` package is located at `/Users/rsc/go/src/math/rand`, and it imports several packages including `internal/godebug`, `math`, `sync`, `sync/atomic`, and `unsafe`. Additionally, there is another version of the package located at `/Users/rsc/go/src/math/rand/v2`, which has similar imports but also includes `errors` and `internal/chacha8rand`. The second command also lists imports from `cmd/compile` for both versions of the package.```",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""import"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches.

Starting with the title: ""cmd/go: list confuses imports"". This suggests that the `go list` command is having issues related to how it handles or displays imports. The word ""confuses"" implies some sort of mix-up or incorrect behavior when dealing with import statements or dependencies.

Looking at the body, the user describes a problem where running `go list std cmd` doesn't show the expected information about the standard `math/rand` package. Instead, it seems to show dependencies compiled for `cmd/compile`. The issue is reported to have appeared between Go 1.20 and 1.21. The provided command outputs show that when using `std`, the imports are as expected, but with `std cmd`, the imports seem to be aliased or pointing to different paths, specifically those under `cmd/compile`.

Now examining the patches. Patch 1 modifies the function `setPGOProfilePath` by cloning both `Imports` and `Internal.Imports` slices when creating a new Package. The comment explains that this is done to prevent aliasing issues, ensuring modifications in one package don't affect another. This directly relates to how imports are handled internally.

Patch 2 adds a test case that checks if the `pgo` tool correctly splits off the Imports field so that modifications in one variant (like adding `.ForMain`) don't cause unexpected behavior in others. The test uses `go list` and compares outputs, focusing on import paths and their mappings.

Both patches are addressing issues where imports might be aliased or incorrectly referenced when using certain commands like `go list`, especially in the context of PGO (Profile Guided Optimization). This suggests that the root cause is related to how imports are managed internally by the Go toolchain.

The label assigned is ""import"". Considering all this, the issue revolves around how imports are handled and displayed by the `go list` command. The patches aim to fix incorrect import handling that leads to confusing or aliased imports in specific scenarios.

Therefore, the label ""import"" accurately reflects the nature of the problem described in the issue report.

I am getting the following exception when running the code -

```The code snippet includes the necessary header for Torch library and defines the `main` function. It prints a 2x3 tensor filled with random values using Torch's random number generation function.```

```The log indicates that an `c10::Error` was thrown due to an ""Unknown layout"" at line 69 of `../c10/core/Layout.h`. The error originated from a call to `operator<<` and was propagated through multiple frames, ultimately terminating the program. The stack trace shows the error occurred within the `torch_cpu` library and was triggered by a call to `at::_ops::rand::call`.```

Tried to use other constructors of tensor and still it fails

`torch::tensor(1)`

```The log indicates that a `c10::Error` was thrown due to an unknown layout when calling the `operator<<` function. The error originated from `../c10/core/Layout.h:69`. The error was propagated through multiple frames in the stack trace, involving functions in `libtorch_cpu.so` and ultimately leading to a call from the user's `main()` function.```
Similar setup works with `torch< 2.2` but not with `torch==2.2.0`

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""layout"" correctly reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The user is encountering an error when using PyTorch's C++ distribution, specifically version 2.2.0. They provided a code snippet that's causing the exception. The error message says ""Unknown layout"" and points to the Layout.h file in the stack trace. This suggests that something's wrong with how tensor layouts are being handled.

Looking at the example they gave: when they run torch::rand({2, 3}), it throws this error. They also tried creating a tensor with torch::tensor(1) and got the same issue. So the problem isn't specific to one function but seems more general, affecting multiple tensor creations.

They mentioned that this worked in versions before 2.2, so something changed in 2.2 that introduced this bug. The user also included their environment details, which might be relevant for troubleshooting.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 updates a prerequisite section, increasing the required GCC version from 9.4.0 or newer to just 9 or later. It seems like they're relaxing the requirement a bit but still ensuring a modern enough compiler is used.

Patch 2 adds error checks for the compiler versions. Specifically, it prevents building with GCC older than 9 and Clang older than 9. This enforces that users have compilers supporting C++17 features properly, which might relate to layout handling in PyTorch.

So, why does this cause an ""Unknown layout"" error? I think it's because older compiler versions might not handle certain C++17 features correctly, especially those related to tensor layouts or memory management. If the compiler is too old, it can't generate code that properly sets up the tensor's layout, leading to this runtime error.

The label assigned was ""layout"". Given that the error message mentions ""Unknown layout"" and the patches are about ensuring the correct C++17 support which affects how layouts are handled, this seems appropriate. The issue is directly tied to problems with tensor layout initialization, so the label fits well.

The function is also accepting connections on a non responsive server port. I get errors on unreachable host, but with host that are reachable any connection to a non existent server port is not resulting in an error.

```The code snippet connects to a TCP socket address provided as a command-line argument within 5 seconds. It prints a success message if the connection is established, or an error message with the failure reason if it times out or fails for another reason.```

Does vxworks fall back on unix implementations for these functionalities? Any leads on how to proceed would be really helpful.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""network"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report based on the provided details.

First, looking at the title: ""std::net::TcpStream::connect_timeout on vxworks"". It mentions TcpStream and connect_timeout, which are related to network operations in Rust. So that's a clue pointing towards networking.

In the body of the issue, the user describes a problem where the connect_timeout function isn't behaving as expected when connecting to a non-responsive server port on VxWorks. They provided example code showing that connections to unavailable ports succeed instead of failing, which indicates an issue with how network connections are handled in this specific OS context.

The patches show changes to socket handling in the Rust standard library, specifically around error checking during connection attempts. The modifications adjust how errors are detected after a poll, especially for VxWorks, where POLLHUP or POLLERR aren't returned as expected. This is directly related to low-level network socket operations and error management.

Considering all these points, the problem revolves around network functionality, particularly how connections are managed and errors are reported in the TcpStream implementation on VxWorks. The label ""network"" accurately captures the essence of this issue.

rust-lang/rust,122211,unsoundness,byval argument of C ABI function passed to Rust ABI function has insufficient alignment,"

I tried this code:

```This Rust code defines a struct `HighAlign` with two 128-bit fields aligned at 16-byte boundaries. It also declares an external function `consume` that takes a reference to `HighAlign`. The `takes_aligned` function ensures that its `HighAlign` argument is properly aligned before calling `consume`.```

I expected to see this happen: Alignment requirements are upheld.

Instead, this happened: <URL>

```The code defines a function `@takes_aligned` that takes a pointer `%x` with high alignment of 4 and passes it to a function `@consume` with an alignment requirement of 16 before returning.```

`%x` is clearly not `align 16` as we indicate. This is unsound.

@rustbot label I-unsound A-ffi

---

This issue is somewhat similar to #80127. The fix for that issue, #112157, made this problem worse by causing Rust and `byval` alignments to differ in more cases. (That change is correct, because the Rust and `byval` alignment must differ to satisfy the ABI. It just uncovered this issue in more cases.)

This is also similar to #112480. However, unlike that one, this issue is practical (and easy) to fix. `byval` pointers are not exposed to Rust code, so we can just make a copy of the argument into a higher-aligned alloca, without breaking Rust semantics.

In fact, we already do this in the reverse situation, when the Rust alignment is lower than the `byval` alignment (<URL>
```The code defines a packed struct `LowAlign` with three 128-bit unsigned integer fields. It also declares an external C function `consume` that takes a `LowAlign` argument. Finally, it provides a Rust function `call_low_align` that calls `consume` with an instance of `LowAlign`, marked as `unsafe`.```
```The code defines a function `@call_low_align` that takes a pointer `%x` with alignment 1 and performs the following actions:
1. Allocates memory for a variable of type `%LowAlign` with alignment 4.
2. Copies 48 bytes from the input pointer `%x` to the allocated memory.
3. Calls a function `@consume` with the copied data.
4. Returns without a value.```

It was compiled for an x86_64 architecture running Linux and uses LLVM version 17.0.6. The compilation process returned successfully with a status code of 0.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, looking at the issue title and body, it seems related to passing structs with certain alignments across different calling conventions, specifically between Rust and C. The problem arises when there's a mismatch in alignment requirements, which can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes if not handled properly.

The user provided some code snippets and patches that were made to resolve the issue. From what I gather, the main problem was that when passing a struct by value (byval) with an alignment different from what Rust expects, the code wasn't correctly copying the argument into an alloca with the right alignment. This could lead to undefined behavior because the C code might expect a certain alignment that isn't met.

The patches include modifications to how arguments are handled when their alignment needs adjustment. For example, in some cases, the code now allocates space on the stack (alloca) and copies the argument into it with the correct alignment before passing it to the external function. This ensures that the called function receives the argument with the expected alignment, preventing potential issues like incorrect memory access or runtime errors.

The term ""unsoundness"" in programming languages refers to situations where a program can violate the language's safety guarantees, leading to undefined behavior. In this context, if the alignment isn't handled correctly, it could cause memory corruption or crashes, which are indeed unsoundness issues because they break the expected safety properties of the language.

Looking at the test cases provided in the patches, there are functions that check whether the argument is copied into an alloca when needed. For instance, on i686-linux, where the alignment might be lower than required, the code ensures that a copy with correct alignment is made before calling the external function. This directly addresses a potential source of unsoundness by preventing misaligned memory accesses.

Therefore, the label ""unsoundness"" seems appropriate because the issue relates to ensuring memory safety and correct behavior when interacting with C code, which is crucial for maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.

ziglang/zig,22362,regression,@errorName not working on selfhosted x86-64 backend,"### Zig Version

0.14.0-dev.2577+271452d22

### Steps to Reproduce and Observed Behavior

Compile this program on linux x86-64:
```The code snippet defines a `main` function that calls `foo`. If `foo` returns an error, `main` catches it and prints the error name using `@errorName`. The `foo` function intentionally returns `error.OutOfMemory` to demonstrate error handling.```
running selfhosted
```The command runs the Zig program `main.zig` without using LLVM or lld for compilation and linking.```
gives
```The code snippet provided is `fMemory`. It appears to be a function call, but without additional context, it's not possible to provide a more detailed summary.```
and running llvm backend gives
```The code snippet `zig run main.zig` is a command to run a Zig program named `main.zig`.````
```The log indicates an ""OutOfMemory"" error.```

On 0.13.0 it works correctly so its regression

### Expected Behavior

I expect output of first and second run to be the same (e.g. ""OutOfMemory"")",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" correctly reflects this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression is. From what I know, a regression in software terms is when a bug or issue is introduced in a newer version of the software that wasn't present in an older version. It's essentially a step backward in functionality.

Looking at the title: ""@errorName not working on selfhosted x86-64 backend"". That tells me there's an issue with the errorName function on a specific setup, which is self-hosted and uses x86-64 architecture. 

Now, diving into the body of the issue. The user provided steps to reproduce, including code snippets and expected behavior. They mentioned that when compiling a certain program using the selfhosted backend (with -fno-llvm and -fno-lld flags), the output is ""fMemory"" instead of ""OutOfMemory"". However, when using the LLVM backend, it works correctly. Importantly, they note that this wasn't an issue in version 0.13.0, which suggests that the problem started after that version.

So, this fits the definition of a regression because something that worked before stopped working in a newer version (0.14.0-dev). The user expects both backends to produce the same output but they don't anymore.

Looking at the patches provided: 

- Patches 1 and 2 seem to modify how error names are handled internally, possibly fixing how strings are stored or referenced.
- Patch 3 adds a test case to check both LLVM and non-LLVM backends, ensuring that the issue is caught in testing.
- Patch 4 exports the errorName function properly.

These patches address the root cause of the bug. Since the problem arose after a previous version worked correctly, labeling it as a regression makes sense because it's an unintended reintroduction of a bug or a new bug that impairs functionality compared to earlier versions.

Therefore, yes, the label ""regression"" accurately reflects this issue report.

spring-projects/spring-framework,32575,runtime error,RestClient observations are stopped before ResponseSpec calls,"Debugging a `RestTemplate` shows that `execute()` bad responses are properly throwing exceptions, which when caught, are setting the error to the observation:
```The code snippet performs the following steps:
1. Executes a request and stores the response.
2. Sets the response in an observation context.
3. Handles the response by calling a method with URL, method, and response as parameters.
4. Extracts data from the response using a response extractor if available, otherwise returns null.
5. Catches and handles `IOException`, creating a `ResourceAccessException` and rethrowing it after logging the error.
6. Catches and logs any other `Throwable`, then rethrows it.```
Doing the same for the `DefaultRestClient` `retrieve` method shows that the `clientRequest.execute()` call is not throwing any exception, thus no error is recorded to the observation (later during the `toEntity` call the exception is thrown, but at that time the client observation is already stopped).
```The code snippet captures a try-catch block that executes a client request, handles exceptions, and logs errors. It sets the client response in an observation context, wraps the response, and exchanges it. Catch blocks manage `IOException` and other `Throwable` exceptions, creating and throwing `ResourceAccessException`.```

What is the idea of the new RestClient implementation, how is it supposed to propagate the exception to the observation?",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""RestClient observations are stopped before ResponseSpec calls."" This suggests that there's a problem with how observations (like logging or monitoring) are being handled in the RestClient. Specifically, the observation is stopping too early, before certain response handling occurs.

The body of the issue provides more details. It compares two implementations: RestTemplate and DefaultRestClient. In RestTemplate, when execute() throws an exception, it's caught and the error is recorded to the observation. However, in DefaultRestClient, during the retrieve method, clientRequest.execute() doesn't throw any exceptions, so no error is logged to the observation. Later, when toEntity is called, an exception is thrown, but by then, the observation has already stopped.

The patches provided show changes made to fix this issue. Let me go through them:

1. **Patch 1** modifies several parts of the code:
   - It adds a parameter `observation` to the method `readWithMessageConverters`.
   - In cases where exceptions are caught, it sets the error on the observation before throwing.
   - It ensures that observations are stopped in the `finally` block after processing.

2. **Patch 2** updates test methods and class names for better clarity, but doesn't directly relate to the bug fix.

The main idea here is ensuring that any exceptions during response handling are properly recorded by the observation before it stops. The problem was that observations were stopping too early, missing error logging when exceptions occurred later in the process.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, such as null pointer exceptions or array index out of bounds. However, this issue isn't about a specific error occurring but rather about the timing and completeness of error logging within observations.

The patches are about ensuring that when exceptions do occur (like RestClientException), they are properly captured in the observation before it's stopped. So the problem is more about correct error handling and logging mechanisms rather than a runtime error itself.

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""runtime error"" might not be accurate because the core issue isn't an unexpected error during execution but rather a flaw in how errors are being logged or tracked.
</think>

The label does not accurately reflect the issue. The problem was about ensuring proper error logging and observation handling, not a runtime error.

However, this condition was not met. The log shows that the view was created, packages were loaded, and some diagnostics were performed, but the specific diagnostics for `main.go` were missing.```
",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""integration"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title mentions a spurious failure in TestGCDetails_Toggle within the codelens integration tests. The body describes a test that's failing because of an unmet condition related to diagnostics, specifically looking for a message containing ""42 escapes"" with certain severity and tags. It also notes that the test passed on retry, which suggests it might be a flaky test.

Looking at the patches provided, Patch 1 modifies the test by replacing AfterChange with OnceMet, adding a CompletedWork condition before checking the Diagnostics expectation. This seems to adjust how the test waits for certain diagnostics to appear after specific work is done. 

Patch 2 updates the comment for the DoneDiagnosingChanges function, clarifying that it's about awaiting various document and workspace change notifications before checking expectations. It also adds a more detailed description of what AfterChange awaits, including different textDocument and workspace events.

Now, considering the label ""integration."" Integration tests typically verify interactions between components or systems, ensuring they work together as expected. The changes here are in test setup and expectations, making the test more reliable by correctly awaiting certain conditions before checking for results. This isn't adding new integration points but rather fixing how the existing integration test behaves.

So, while the issue is about an integration test failure, the patches don't add or modify integration aspects per se; they adjust the test's timing and expectations to prevent spurious failures. Therefore, the label ""integration"" might not be the most accurate because it doesn't directly relate to integrating components but rather to test reliability.

However, since the issue is within an integration test file and involves how the test integrates with the server's behavior, there's a case for the label being appropriate. But I'm leaning towards it not being the best fit because the core problem was about test flakiness due to timing issues, not integration logic.
</think>

The label ""integration"" is somewhat relevant as the issue pertains to an integration test. However, the patches address test reliability rather than integrating components.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this issue report based on the information provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is saying.

The user provided a series of patches from a GitHub repository and some test cases. The main focus seems to be around fixing issues related to joining tables, especially when dealing with large data types like bigint unsigned and bit(64). There are tests added in Patches 21 and 24 that check if certain joins behave correctly when comparing these large integer types.

Patch 1 through Patch 20 show various code changes, but they don't add new features. Instead, they seem to fix existing bugs or improve how the system handles specific data types during joins. For example, in Patch 17, there's a change in checking the length of segments which might be related to handling larger data without causing errors.

The labels given by GitHub are important here. The issue report was assigned the label ""enhancement."" But looking at the patches and test cases, it seems like these changes are addressing specific bugs or improving correctness rather than adding new features. Enhancements usually refer to new functionalities or significant improvements, not necessarily bug fixes.

Moreover, the tests added in Patches 21 and 24 are testing for correct behavior when comparing different integer types across tables. This suggests that prior to these patches, there might have been incorrect results or errors when performing such joins, indicating a bug fix rather than an enhancement.

So, considering all this, I don't think ""enhancement"" is the right label here. These changes are more about fixing issues and improving correctness rather than introducing new features or enhancements.

```This PHP code defines an interface `I` with a getter property `prop`. It then creates a class `A` that implements this interface, providing a private property `_prop` and a public property `prop` with a getter method that returns the value of `_prop`.```

Resulted in this output:
```The log indicates an AddressSanitizer error resulting in a segmentation violation (SEGV) on an unknown address `0x7f698aba28e0`. The error is caused by a write memory access. The stack trace points to the `dasm_encode` function in `dasm_x86.h` at line 415, which is part of the JIT compilation process in PHP's opcache extension.```

To reproduce:
```The code snippet sets configuration options for PHP's OPCache and JIT compiler in a PHP INI file format. It includes enabling OPCache, specifying JIT settings, and configuring preload and implicit flush behavior.```

Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. 

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Segmentation fault in ext/opcache/jit/ir/dynasm/dasm_x86.h"". A segmentation fault is a type of runtime error that occurs when a program attempts to access memory it shouldn't, which typically leads to a crash. So the title itself suggests a crash.

Next, examining the body of the issue: The user provided a PHP code snippet that resulted in an AddressSanitizer error, specifically a SEGV (segmentation violation) due to a WRITE memory access. This indicates that the program crashed because it tried to write to an invalid memory address. The stack trace points to functions related to the JIT compiler and opcache, which are part of performance optimizations in PHP.

The patches provided include changes in the opcache code where there's a comment referencing this issue (GH-15657) and mentioning that they fixed a bug causing a segmentation fault. Additionally, Patch 2 shows modifications around JIT handling, disabling it temporarily to prevent the crash during certain operations. This confirms that the issue was indeed causing a crash related to memory access violations.

Patch 3 adds a test case that triggers the bug by implementing an interface with a property, which leads to the crash. The test expects the script to output ""Done"" without crashing, ensuring that the fix works.

The label assigned is ""crash"", which aligns well with all these observations: the issue caused a segmentation fault leading to a program crash, and the patches were aimed at preventing this crash by managing JIT compilation correctly.

Okay, let's try to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this issue report. 

Looking at the problem description, it seems like there are various errors related to incorrect time or datetime values during ALTER TABLE operations. For instance, when trying to modify a column from one type to another (like bigint to datetime), an error occurs because the value doesn't fit the new type.

Now, considering what a runtime error is: typically, it refers to an error that happens while the program is executing, not at compile time. These errors can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. In this case, the errors are happening during runtime when executing specific SQL commands, so they do fit into the runtime error category.

The patches provided also adjust how these errors are handled, ensuring that invalid values lead to appropriate errors rather than incorrect behavior. This aligns with fixing runtime issues where operations fail due to invalid data or constraints.

So yes, the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the problem described.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the provided information carefully.

The title of the issue is ""Nilpointer in dartsass.Close"". That immediately tells me that there's a null pointer exception happening somewhere in the Close method related to dartsass. 

Looking at the body, it starts with a note about an underlying error possibly being masked. The user mentions Hugo 0.139.0 dropping support for v1 of Dart Sass embedded protocol, which might still be in use by some old versions. They also provided a link to another discussion about a panic when building on Netlify.

The stack trace shows that the build script failed with exit code 2. It mentions a runtime error due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference. Specifically, it points out that the Close method in dartsass.Transpiler was called on a nil (zero) value, leading to a segmentation violation.

Now, looking at the patches applied:

Patch 1 seems to adjust how resources are handled in a template file, changing from `resources.PostCSS` to `css.PostCSS`. Not directly related to the nil pointer in Close, but perhaps part of a broader fix.

Patch 2 is more substantial. It modifies the New function in client.go to return an empty Client instead of setting dartSassNotAvailable when Dart Sass isn't supported. The struct for Client loses the dartSassNotAvailable boolean and adds a comment that transpiler may be nil if Dart Sass isn't available. The Close method now checks if transpiler is nil before attempting to close it, preventing the nil pointer dereference.

Putting this together, the issue was indeed a runtime error caused by calling Close on a nil transpiler instance. The patches fix this by properly checking for nil before closing and adjusting how the Client is initialized when Dart Sass isn't available.

The label ""runtime error"" fits because the problem occurred during execution due to an invalid memory access, which is a type of runtime error.

JuliaLang/julia,57141,bug,v1.12 throws `UndefVarError: not defined in local scope` for variable renamed in function before being captured by a closure,"~I've not yet been able to create a minimal reproduction of this that doesn't depend on a private package (sorry), but~ i can at least start a bisect to try to find the offending commit.

[Edit: better repro in message below]

In a private package, which has a function like
```This Julia code defines a function `assign_node_ids` that assigns unique IDs to nodes in a graph structure. It supports an optional starting ID. If no starting ID is provided, it defaults to starting from 0. The function uses a recursive helper function `_traverse` to traverse and reassign IDs to nodes. The main function returns the modified node structure and the next available ID. A second, simpler function is provided to call the first with a default starting ID of 0 if none is specified.```
Calling the function like
```The code snippet creates a node using `make_node` and then assigns IDs to the node using `assign_node_ids`.```
throws
`````The log indicates an `UndefVarError` stating that the variable `ii` is not defined in the local scope. It suggests checking for a local variable assignment that might be shadowing a global variable of the same name. The error occurs at line 104 of the `traversal.jl` file in the `Utilities` module of the `RAI_BackIR` package.```

The error disappears if the function is marked `@noinline` or the variable isn't renamed in the function, i.e.
```The code snippet defines a Julia function `assign_node_ids` that assigns node IDs starting from a given integer. The function is marked with `@noinline`, indicating that the compiler should not inline this function.```
or 
```The code snippet defines a Julia function `assign_node_ids` that takes a `node` and an integer `ii` as arguments. The function body is omitted.```

",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the problem described.

The title mentions that v1.12 throws a `UndefVarError` for a variable renamed in a function before being captured by a closure. So, it seems like there's an error occurring where a variable isn't defined when it should be, specifically related to closures capturing variables after renaming.

Looking at the body, the user provides code snippets and explains that when they run their function, it throws this UndefVarError. They mention that marking the function with `@noinline` or not renaming the variable fixes the issue. This suggests that there's something wrong with how the compiler is handling variable renaming in functions that have closures.

Now, the patches provided are two. The first patch modifies some code related to sroa_pass!, which I think is part of the compiler's optimization passes, maybe for Single Return Optimization or something similar. It adds a filter to remove uses that have been optimized away by DCE (Dead Code Elimination). 

The second patch seems to add a test case where it checks that `setfield!` isn't eliminated when the field is used. This might be related to ensuring that certain optimizations don't incorrectly remove code that's actually needed, which could cause variables to not be defined as expected.

Putting this together, the issue arises from how the compiler optimizes or handles variable scoping in closures, leading to a variable being undefined. The patches aim to fix this by adjusting optimization passes and adding tests to prevent such issues. Since this is an unintended behavior causing errors, it fits the definition of a bug rather than a feature request or enhancement.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue because it describes a problem in the code that needs fixing.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate as the issue describes an unexpected error due to a variable not being defined, which is caused by a flaw in how the compiler handles closures and optimizations. The provided patches aim to correct this behavior.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""performance"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue report provided. Let me break down what's in the issue and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""AOTAutograd has_same_metadata call in collect_metadata_analysis.py is quadratic."" The word ""quadratic"" here suggests that there's an issue with the algorithm's time complexity. Quadratic time can lead to performance problems because as the input size increases, the time taken grows rapidly.

Next, the body of the issue describes a bug where running a benchmark with N set to 1000 shows a quadratic behavior in a specific part of the code. The user provided a profile image, which likely shows that the function is taking too much time. They also mention that this happens when using AOTAutograd, which relates to ahead-of-time compilation for autograd functions—something that's performance-sensitive.

Looking at the patches applied:

Patch 1 changes how tensors are stored and compared. Instead of a defaultdict(set), they're now using a more structured approach with MetadataKey. This suggests an optimization where instead of checking each tensor for metadata equality, which could be O(n^2) time, they're grouping them by their metadata keys first. So the comparison becomes faster because you only compare tensors that share the same metadata key.

Patch 2 introduces a new dataclass called MetadataKey and modifies the has_same_metadata function to use this key. This likely reduces the number of comparisons needed by creating a hashable key for each tensor's metadata, allowing for quicker lookups and thus reducing the overall time complexity from quadratic to linear or near-linear.

Patch 3 adds SymIntEqByExpr, which changes how integer expressions are compared. Instead of using their values directly, they use the underlying sympy expressions. This ensures that comparisons are done based on the structure of the expressions rather than just their integer values, which could prevent unnecessary equality checks and speed up the process.

Putting this all together: The issue was about a quadratic time complexity causing performance degradation. The patches restructure how metadata is handled to reduce the number of comparisons needed, thus improving performance by reducing the time taken from O(n^2) to something more efficient.

So yes, the label ""performance"" accurately reflects this issue because it's all about optimizing the code to run faster and handle larger inputs without a significant slowdown.

Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""cmd/go: TestScript/build_json failures [consistent failure]"". The word ""failures"" here suggests that there are test failures occurring. The term ""[consistent failure]"" indicates it's a recurring problem.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It mentions a specific test case, TestScript/build_json, which is failing consistently. The example log shows that the test output doesn't match the expected pattern, leading to a failure. This confirms that the test is indeed failing and causing issues with the build process.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Both Patch 1 and Patch 2 modify the expected output in the test cases by adjusting regular expressions to account for different path separators (using (/|\\\\)). This change aims to make the tests more robust across different operating systems, particularly handling both Unix and Windows path formats correctly.

The label assigned is ""failure"". The issue report is about a failing test, which directly relates to a failure in the system. The patches address this by fixing the test's expected output, which suggests that without these changes, the tests would continue to fail, hence the issue is indeed about a failure scenario.

Therefore, considering all aspects—title indicating failures, body detailing the specific failed test, and patches aimed at correcting those failures—the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue.

go-gitea/gitea,31738,runtime error,Internal Server Error on push (GetAffectedFiles()),"### Description

I was testing how branch protection works and if it is possible to protect modification of `.gitea/actions` from being modified in a PR. As far as I understand, Gitea is executing actions code from a PR, and not from `main`, but this must be another issue.

Here is the following bug.
If branch protection is set for branch `*` all pushes to new branches will fail with ""`Gitea: Internal Server Error (no message for end users)`""

How to reproduce:
1. Create a branch protection for branch `*`, set protected files to `.gitea/**;mkdocs.yml;mkdocs.yaml`, push - `Enable Push`
2. clone repo via ssh, and do:
```The log shows the creation and switching to a new Git branch named `pr-test`, adding and committing a file named `text.txt`, and attempting to push the changes to a remote repository hosted on Gitea. The push operation fails due to a ""pre-receive hook declined"" error, indicating that a server-side hook prevented the push from completing successfully.```

(Without protected files it works - this is how a new branch was created on demo.gitea)

`gitea.log` has following entries (hashes are differ from example above):
```The log indicates several errors occurred while processing operations on the `someorg/doc-test` repository located at `/data/git/repositories/someorg/doc-test.git`. Specifically:

1. An invalid repository was encountered.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: ""Internal Server Error on push (GetAffectedFiles())"". This suggests that when pushing changes, an internal server error occurs, specifically mentioning a function called GetAffectedFiles(). Internal Server Errors usually indicate something went wrong on the server side, often due to unhandled exceptions or bugs in the code.

Next, I'll examine the issue body. The user describes how they encountered this problem while testing branch protection settings. When pushing to a new branch with certain protected files set, it results in an internal server error. They provided steps to reproduce the issue, including Git commands and the resulting error message. The logs from gitea.log show errors related to GetAffectedFiles() failing with exit status 128, indicating that there was a problem executing this function.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve the issue:

- Patch 1 adds new test functions related to getting commit branch starts.
- Patch 2 modifies the GetAffectedFiles function to handle cases where oldCommitID is empty by fetching the start commit of the branch.
- Patches 3 and 4 adjust how branches are retrieved, passing environment variables correctly.
- Patches 5 and 6 update functions like preReceiveBranch, CheckFileProtection, and CheckUnprotectedFiles to include the branch name in their parameters.

These changes suggest that the issue was due to incorrect handling of commit IDs when the oldCommitID was empty (like when pushing a new branch). The GetAffectedFiles function wasn't correctly determining the start commit for branches, leading to an error during file protection checks. This caused the internal server error because the pre-receive hook failed.

The term ""runtime error"" typically refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as null pointer exceptions, division by zero, or unexpected conditions that weren't handled properly. In this case, the problem was an unhandled scenario where oldCommitID was empty, leading to incorrect function behavior and thus causing the server to crash with an internal error.

Therefore, labeling this issue as a ""runtime error"" is appropriate because it points to a flaw in the code's execution flow that wasn't properly handled, resulting in a server-side error.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue because it stems from unhandled conditions during code execution leading to an internal server error.

rust-lang/rust,131834,runtime error,Drop the dereferenceable attribute when a reference is passed in an enum,"Considering [the following code](<URL> it should print 0 with a release build, but I get a segmentation violation.

```This Rust code defines a restricted address type `RestrictedAddress` with a specific valid range for its underlying pointer. It also defines an enum `E` with variants that include `RestrictedAddress`. The function `foo` matches on the enum and dereferences the `RestrictedAddress` if the variant is `A`, otherwise returns 0. The `main` function calls `foo` with a black-boxed `E::B` to prevent optimization.```

This is because we are adding the `dereferenceable` attribute, which allows LLVM to hoist the load instruction. In this case, we need to drop the `dereferenceable` attribute.

@rustbot label +requires-nightly +I-miscompile +A-codegen",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title says: ""Drop the dereferenceable attribute when a reference is passed in an enum."" Hmm, that sounds like it's about how the Rust compiler handles certain attributes related to pointers or references in enums. The body of the issue includes some Rust code and explains that running this code causes a segmentation fault instead of printing 0 as expected.

Looking at the provided Rust code, it uses some internal features like `rustc_attrs` and defines a struct `RestrictedAddress` with specific layout attributes. There's an enum E with variants, one of which takes a `RestrictedAddress`. The function `foo` matches on the enum and tries to dereference the `RestrictedAddress` if it's variant A; otherwise, it returns 0.

The problem arises when running this code in release mode—it causes a segmentation violation. The user explains that this happens because the `dereferenceable` attribute is added, allowing LLVM to hoist the load instruction, which isn't safe here. They want to drop this attribute to fix the issue.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies the `PointeeInfo` struct, adding more fields and comments about how the information is advisory and can cause UB if wrong. It seems to be adjusting how pointer info is handled.

Patch 2 changes how data variants are determined in the codegen. It adds checks for whether a pointer is null or dereferenceable by examining the enum's structure and tag encoding. It ensures that only certain conditions allow the pointer to be considered safe, which might prevent incorrect optimizations.

Patch 3 updates `ArgAttributes` comments to clarify that `dereferenceable_or_null` is used instead of `dereferenceable`. This suggests a change in how these attributes are applied, making sure they're only set when appropriate.

Patch 4 modifies some test cases. It adds a new function with checks for non-null and non-dereferenceable pointers, ensuring that the compiler doesn't incorrectly apply attributes in cases where it's unsafe.

Now, considering all this, the issue is about incorrect code generation leading to a runtime error (segmentation fault). The patches aim to correct how the compiler handles pointer attributes to prevent such errors. 

The label assigned was ""runtime error."" Since the problem manifests as a crash during execution and the patches fix codegen to avoid that, the label seems appropriate because it correctly identifies that the issue causes an error at runtime.

**Describe your issue**

When using `@tailwindcss/vite`, and creating an SSR build with Vite, the CSS asset paths differ between the SSR and client builds. This is not true with `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

The above repos contain a minimal reproduction case, starting from a fresh React Vite project. Here are the reproduction steps below showing the bug:

With the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin:

```The logs show two builds executed using `bun` and `vite`. The first build targets the client-side application, producing various assets including CSS and JavaScript files, with the build completing in 463 milliseconds. The second build targets the server-side application, generating an SSR bundle in 55 milliseconds. The `entry-ssr.js` file contains a reference to the client-side stylesheet located at `/assets/App-DX11wV_z.css`.```

Note the asset path of the built `App.css` differs between the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css !== App-DWNkNxeI.css`). This means that SSR rendered responses have the incorrect asset URL (which leads to a hydration error, if you are hydrating – or a missing CSS asset if you are only SSR rendering).

With the `@tailwindcss/postcss` based plugin:

```The script performs the following steps:

1. Builds the client-side application using `bun build:client`.
2. Builds the client-side application with Vite, outputting to `build/client`, and generates a manifest file.
3. Builds the server-side application using `bun build:server`.
4. Builds the server-side application with Vite, outputting to `build/server` and using `src/entry-ssr.tsx` for SSR.
5. Searches for the inclusion of the client-side CSS asset path in the server-side build output, confirming that `/assets/App-BYq-i2yi.css` is included.```

Note the asset path of the built `App.css` matches the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css === App-BYq-i2yi.css`).

Let me know if I can provide any more information.",1,"<think>

I remember that in the past, there was an issue where adding or changing files outside of the main configuration wouldn't trigger a rebuild. This caused problems because developers expected their Tailwind styles to update when they added new classes or components elsewhere.

Looking at the patches, it seems like the main focus is on how dependencies are tracked. The `requiresBuild` method now checks file modification times instead of relying on a flag (`requiresRebuild`). Also, there's better handling of build dependencies by using a map to track file paths and their last modified times.

This suggests that the problem was with the plugin not detecting changes correctly in certain scenarios. By improving how dependencies are monitored, the plugin becomes more reliable. It ensures that any relevant file changes trigger a rebuild, which is crucial for a seamless development experience.

The label ""plugin"" makes sense here because all these changes are within the Vite plugin codebase. They're not core Tailwind CSS features but rather how the plugin integrates with Vite's build system.

So yes, labeling this as a plugin issue accurately reflects that the problem lies within the plugin's functionality and its interaction with the build environment.
</think>

The label ""plugin"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to the Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS, focusing on dependency handling and rebuild triggers within the plugin.

The tests also attempt to access a deeply nested directory path, resulting in a ""permission denied"" error.```

Assigning to @ianlancetaylor as he has worked on this test previously.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""os: TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet failing on android trybots."" This tells me that a specific test, TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet, is failing on Android build bots. So the problem is related to a test failure in the 'os' package when running on Android.

Now, reading the body of the issue. The user provided logs from the failed tests. Both TestGetwdDeep and TestGetwdDeepWithPWDSet are failing because they're trying to open a directory with a path that's way too long, leading to a permission denied error (EACCES). They also mentioned that this happens consistently on Android trybots.

The patches made to fix this issue change the error handling in the test. Originally, it was checking for EPERM and logging it as an ignorable error. The patch changes this to check for EACCES instead, which is the correct error code for permission issues. This makes sense because when the test tries to access directories higher up that it doesn't have permissions for on Android, it should expect EACCES rather than EPERM.

So the issue here is about a failing test caused by incorrect error handling in the test code itself. The problem isn't a runtime error in the production code but rather an issue with how the test handles errors during execution. The test was expecting the wrong type of error, leading to failures when run on Android.

The label ""runtime error"" typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the program, not during testing. Since this is a test failure due to incorrect error handling in the test code, it's more about test reliability rather than a runtime problem.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue because the problem lies within the test cases and how they handle specific errors on certain platforms, not an actual runtime error in the application itself.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" is incorrect for this issue. The problem was with a failing test due to improper error handling, not a runtime error.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for Tensor.add_ not checking for errors."" The title suggests that there's a problem with how fake tensors are handling the add_ operation in Dynamo, specifically related to error checking.

The body provides more context. It mentions a similar issue and includes a reproducible example using pytest. When running the test, an error occurs because of a type mismatch—trying to cast Float to Long, which isn't allowed. The traceback shows a RuntimeError during the execution of the compiled function, indicating that Dynamo didn't handle this correctly.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies some test files by removing an xfailIfTorchDynamo decorator from a test method. This suggests that previously, tests were failing under TorchDynamo but now they're expected to pass, meaning the issue is resolved.

Patch 2 adds several checks in the meta_binop_inplace_alpha function. It introduces functions like is_integeric, is_floatic, and is_booleanic to determine the types of operands. Then it explicitly raises RuntimeErrors when trying to perform operations that would change the element size, such as adding a float to an integer tensor or mixing boolean with non-boolean tensors in-place.

These changes seem to fix the issue by properly checking for type promotions that aren't allowed in in-place operations, thus preventing silent failures and ensuring correct error handling.

So, putting it all together: The problem was that Dynamo's fake tensor implementation wasn't correctly checking for certain type errors during in-place operations like add_. This caused incorrect behavior or unexpected results. The patches fix this by adding proper checks and raising appropriate errors when such invalid operations are attempted.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" is accurate because it describes a defect in the code where Dynamo didn't handle these cases correctly, leading to runtime errors instead of properly preventing type mismatches.
</think>

The issue report accurately describes a bug where Dynamo's fake tensor implementation failed to check for specific error conditions during in-place operations, causing incorrect behavior. The patches address this by adding necessary checks and error handling.

Alright, let's break down whether the label ""failure"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the issue title: ""[CI] ShardBulkInferenceActionFilterIT testBulkOperations {p0=false} failing."" This clearly indicates that a specific test case is failing in the CI environment. The presence of ""failing"" in the title suggests that the problem is related to a test failure.

Next, examining the body of the issue provides more details. It mentions build scans with multiple links, which likely point to failed builds where this issue occurred. There's a reproduction line showing how to run the failing test locally, though it notes that it doesn't reproduce locally, which might mean it's an intermittent or environment-specific issue.

The failure message is ""Test abandoned because suite timeout was reached,"" indicating that the test didn't complete in the allowed time, leading to a timeout. This is another type of failure—specifically, a timeout failure.

Looking at the reasons for the issue: there are multiple failures mentioned across different steps and pipelines, such as part-2 step and elasticsearch-pull-request pipeline. These all point to recurring issues that are causing test failures consistently over several runs.

Now, considering the patches made. Patch 1 removes some failing tests from being executed, which suggests that these specific tests were problematic. Patches 2 and 3 modify how certain operations are handled in the codebase, possibly addressing the root cause of the timeout or failure in those tests. The changes relate to synthetic source handling and snapshot creation, which could be directly causing the test failures if not optimized properly.

Putting it all together: the issue is about a failing test case in CI, supported by specific error messages and multiple instances across different builds. The patches aim to fix these failures either by removing problematic tests or adjusting underlying code that caused timeouts or incorrect behavior. Therefore, the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue as it's centered around test failures and their resolution.
</think>

The label ""failure"" is appropriate because the issue report describes a failing CI test with supporting evidence in build scans and failure messages. The patches address these test failures by modifying code and removing problematic tests.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ci"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

Looking at the title: ""[CI] MvPercentileTests testEvaluateBlockWithoutNulls {TestCase=field: <positive mv DEDUPLICATED_AND_SORTED_ASCENDING longs>, percentile: <small positive double>} failing."" It mentions a CI build and a specific test failure. The body provides details about the build scans, reproduction steps, applicable branches, and the failure message which is an assertion error between two long values.

The patches show changes in the code related to how percentiles are calculated and tested. They modified functions to use matchers that allow for a range of acceptable values instead of exact matches, especially for longs where a small variance is permitted due to potential precision issues with large numbers.

Now, considering the label ""ci"": CI stands for Continuous Integration. This issue was detected because a test started failing in the CI pipeline. The problem wasn't directly about the code functionality but rather the test's expectations not accounting for possible minor variations in results when dealing with very large long values. Therefore, the fix involved adjusting the test assertions to be more flexible.

So the label ""ci"" accurately reflects that this issue was identified through the CI process and relates to test failures within that context.
</think>

The label ""ci"" is appropriate because the issue arose from a failing test in the Continuous Integration pipeline, as indicated by the title and body. The patches addressed the test's assertion logic to accommodate expected variations.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""feature request"" accurately reflects the given issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is showing.

First, there's an issue report with various patches applied to a repository. The question is whether assigning the label ""feature request"" to this issue is correct based on its title, body, and the provided patches.

Looking at the patches, I see that they modify several files related to Rust's intrinsics. For example, Patch 28 adds `#[rustc_intrinsic]` and `#[rustc_intrinsic_must_be_overridden]` attributes to a function, which suggests changes in how certain intrinsic functions are handled or exposed by the compiler.

Intrinsics in Rust are low-level functions that are part of the standard library but are implemented in a way that bypasses the usual ABI. They're often used for performance-critical operations. Modifying these intrinsics could be about adding new functionality, changing their behavior, or improving how they're handled by the compiler.

The patches also include changes to error messages and tests, like adjusting when certain errors are thrown during constant evaluation. For example, in Patch 23, it looks like there's a test that checks if using `copy_nonoverlapping` with invalid pointers correctly throws an error. This indicates that the issue might be about ensuring the intrinsics behave correctly under various conditions.

Another patch (Patch 27) deals with transmuting function pointers to intrinsic functions, which again relates to how these low-level operations are handled by the compiler and runtime.

Now, considering what a ""feature request"" typically entails. A feature request usually involves adding new functionality or making enhancements to an existing system. The patches here seem more about fixing bugs or improving the internal handling of intrinsics rather than adding a new user-facing feature.

However, sometimes changes to intrinsic functions can be part of larger feature work, like improving performance or enabling new language features that rely on these intrinsics. But in this case, the focus seems to be on correct behavior and error handling rather than introducing a new feature per se.

Alternatively, if these patches are part of adding support for a new feature that relies on updated intrinsics, then ""feature request"" might make sense. For example, if a new language feature requires changes to how certain intrinsics work, then this could be considered as part of the feature's implementation.

But without more context from the issue title or body, it's hard to say definitively. Based solely on the patches provided, they seem more like bug fixes or internal improvements rather than a feature request. Feature requests usually involve adding something new that users can utilize, whereas these changes are under-the-hood adjustments.

So, if the issue is about improving how intrinsics work internally without exposing new functionality to end-users, then labeling it as a ""feature request"" might not be accurate. It would be more appropriate for bug fixes or internal improvements.

However, I could be missing some context where these patches are indeed enabling a new feature, making the label correct. But based on what's shown here, I'm leaning towards it not being a feature request.

This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""runtime"" is appropriate for this issue based on the provided information. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions test failures in various tests like testFallbackIndicesOptions and others. These are failing with specific error rates across different executions. So the problem seems to be related to testing infrastructure or how certain parts of the code behave under particular conditions.

Next, I check the patches provided. The first patch removes some test classes from a test suite. It specifically mentions removing tests related to ClusterRequestTests and an issue number linked to that change. The second patch modifies a method in the test class, changing how versions are handled when creating a test instance. Instead of using a version between 8.14.0 and 8.16.0, it now uses versions up to just before 8.16.0.

This suggests that the issue was related to compatibility or behavior changes in different versions of Elasticsearch, particularly around how cluster requests are handled when falling back to older indices. The test was probably failing because it was using a version range that included 8.16.0, which might have introduced some breaking changes or behaviors that the tests weren't expecting.

The label ""runtime"" typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the software, such as performance problems, crashes, or incorrect behavior when running the application. In this case, since the issue was causing test failures due to how versions were being handled in the code under test, it does relate to the runtime environment. The tests are part of ensuring that the runtime behaves correctly across different versions.

Therefore, the label ""runtime"" seems appropriate because the problem is about how the system behaves during execution when handling different transport versions and cluster requests. The patches adjust version handling to prevent the tests from failing, which directly impacts the runtime behavior of the application.

Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Repo Topic Containing Backslash Leads to Javascript Error."" The word ""Error"" is present, and it specifically mentions a JavaScript error. So that's a clue pointing towards a runtime issue because JavaScript errors typically occur during execution.

Next, looking at the body of the issue, there's an error message provided. The error says: ""Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-value=""test\""]"". This looks like a JavaScript error from jQuery, as it references jquery.js with line numbers. Since this error occurs when creating a repo topic with a backslash, it's happening during the execution of the code, which suggests it's a runtime problem.

The user also mentions that it's unclear if it's an escape code issue or a larger problem, but the presence of an error message indicates something went wrong when the code tried to execute. They provided steps to reproduce, which involves interacting with the repository settings—again, something that happens at runtime.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. There are multiple patches, but I'll focus on a few key ones. Patch 2 modifies how values are encoded using encodeURIComponent without trying to decode first. This change directly affects how data is handled when the code runs, preventing incorrect encoding that could cause syntax errors.

Patch 3 changes an event handler from 'touchstart' to 'click', which affects how user interactions are processed in real-time. Incorrect event handling can lead to runtime errors if elements aren't properly selected or if events aren't correctly captured.

Another patch (numbered 8) removes some code related to Fomantic API patches, which was causing issues with URL encoding. This suggests that the original problem might have been due to incorrect handling of URLs during execution, leading to runtime errors when certain characters were present.

Additionally, in Patch 3 again, there's a change where data-value attributes are now using CSS.escape instead of deQuote. This ensures that any special characters like backslashes are properly escaped in selectors, preventing the JavaScript errors seen at runtime.

Considering all these points—the error message, the reproduction steps involving user interaction, and the patches addressing encoding and event handling—it seems clear that the issue is a runtime error occurring when the application tries to process certain input, leading to exceptions being thrown.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""feature request"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied to resolve it.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Feature Request: Enhanced Task Management UI"". This clearly suggests that someone is asking for a new feature or an improvement in the user interface related to task management. So the label seems appropriate here because feature requests are about adding or enhancing functionalities.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It describes several changes made through patches, which include adding new components, modifying existing UI elements like tables and buttons, introducing name analyzers for tasks, and updating various files to implement these features. These changes seem to be substantial enhancements rather than simple bug fixes or minor tweaks. They add new functionalities and improve the user interface, which aligns with what a feature request typically encompasses.

Looking at the patches provided: 

- Patches 1 through 10 show significant additions and modifications across multiple files. For example, adding new components like `TaskNameAnalyzer`, enhancing the Tasks component with filtering, pagination, sorting, and expanding/collapsing features, updating UI elements to be more interactive (like clickable paths), and integrating these into existing pages. These changes are not just fixing issues but rather introducing new capabilities and improving user experience.

- The presence of UI/UX improvements, such as adding checkboxes, sortable columns, and expandable sections, further indicates that this is a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

Considering all these points, the label ""feature request"" accurately captures the nature of the issue. It's about adding new features and improving the existing user interface for better task management.

Gitea made a poor descision (IMHO) to use the separator '-' between groupID and artifactID.

Both result in the same URL:

Although a '-' in a groupID is not ""good-practice"", it is not forbidden and perfectly valid and in common use.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""package management"" is appropriate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's in the issue.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it says something about maven metadata and checksums. That immediately makes me think it's related to how Maven handles its dependencies and package metadata, which falls under package management.

Next, I read through the body of the issue. It seems like someone has made several patches or changes to a repository, possibly to fix issues related to Maven. They provided code snippets showing modifications in how files are handled, checksums are generated, and metadata is managed. All these terms—metadata, checksums, versions—are directly tied to package management systems, especially in the context of Java where Maven is commonly used.

The user then assigned a label ""package management"" to this issue report. My task is to determine if that's accurate based on the provided content. From what I can see, all the changes and discussions revolve around managing Maven packages, including how metadata is stored, versions are handled, and checksums are verified. These are core aspects of package management.

So, putting it all together, the label ""package management"" does indeed accurately reflect the nature of this issue report because it's dealing with the mechanics of handling and managing software packages using Maven.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue isn't provided here, but the body includes a lot of technical details about building PyTorch from source using CMake and the subsequent environment setup. The user also shared some patches that were applied to resolve the problem they faced.

The patches show changes in how the project handles the MKL library integration. Before the patch, there was a condition checking if the target `caffe2::mkl` didn't exist, then adding it as an interface library. After the patch, this condition is inverted: if the target exists, it returns early; otherwise, it adds the library.

This suggests that without the patch, the build process might have been trying to add a target that already existed or wasn't properly handled, leading to some kind of error during compilation or configuration. This would typically be classified as a bug because it's an unintended behavior causing the build to fail or misbehave.

The label ""bug"" is appropriate here since the issue was resolved by correcting how the MKL library target was being added in CMake, which indicates that there was a flaw or mistake in the original code. The patches fixed this flaw, allowing the build to proceed successfully.

Okay, let's see what I need to do here. I have an issue report with some code patches, and I'm supposed to determine if the label ""region"" accurately reflects the problem based on the provided information.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions a bug where restore operations are not correctly handling split regions. That immediately tells me that the problem is related to how regions are being managed during restores. Regions in TiKV are used for data distribution and splitting them can affect performance and data placement.

Now, diving into the patches provided:

Patch 10 shows modifications in the rewriteRawKey function, which seems related to handling key prefixes and rewriting them according to some rules. It adds a new function RewriteAndEncodeRawKey that replaces a part of the key with a new prefix. This might be part of how data is being read or rewritten during restore, possibly affecting region splits.

Patch 11 updates the Go library dependencies, adding ""//pkg/ddl"" which suggests that the fix involves changes related to DDL (Data Definition Language) operations. DDL often deals with schema changes, and in the context of TiKV, this could relate to how regions are split or merged based on table structures.

Patch 12 modifies import statements, bringing in ""sync/atomic"" and updating the runRestore function. The key part here is a change in the RestoreTables method call, where it now checks if ddl.EnableSplitTableRegion is set using atomic.LoadUint32. This indicates that the restore process is now considering whether to split regions based on some configuration. Previously, this might not have been handled correctly.

Patch 13 adjusts a test command line to include ""--merge-region-key-count 1"", which seems to be testing region merging behavior with a specific key count. This directly relates to how regions are managed during restore operations.

Putting it all together: the issue revolves around incorrect handling of region splits during restore. The patches modify functions related to key rewriting, DDL handling, and configuration checks for splitting regions. These changes ensure that regions are split correctly based on the appropriate configurations, addressing the bug reported.

The label ""region"" accurately captures the essence of this issue because it's all about how regions are managed—splitting, merging, or handling them during restore operations. Therefore, assigning the ""region"" label is correct.

This led to a test failure, resulting in an error message indicating that the test run had completed with errors.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue title says there's an error in comparing `getnameinfo` results in a Sockets CI test. The body includes an error message from a test failure where `getnameinfo(ip""203.0.113.1"")` was expected to return the IP string but instead returned ""customer1.example.com"". That means the function isn't behaving as intended, which sounds like a bug.

Looking at the patch provided, it skips the failing test by adding `@test_skip` and mentions it's temporarily broken due to a DNS issue. This indicates that there was indeed a problem in the code that needed fixing, so using the ""bug"" label makes sense because it points out where something went wrong.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but just focusing on whether ""bug"" fits. Since the test was failing because of unexpected behavior from `getnameinfo`, labeling this as a bug accurately reflects the problem.

denoland/deno,25045,logging,Enable `log` feature of `tracing` crate,"## Proposal

Enable the `tracing` crate's `log` feature in order to be able to inspect logs generated from some third party crates that use `tracing` for logging, such as `hyper`.

## Motivation

We use the `log` and `env_logger` for logging. So we can view logs by setting the `RUST_LOG` env var appropriately. We can even look at logs generated by third party crates that use `log` in the same way. However, some crates use `tracing` instead of `log`, and by default the `tracing` crate does not emit logs in a way that can be viewed with `env_logger`. To get the `tracing` mechanism to work well with the `log` ecosystem, we need to enable the `log` feature in the `tracing` crate.

<URL>

Note that although we don't directly use `tracing` in our code, the only way to enable the `log` feature in `tracing` as far as I searched is to add an explicit dependency on `tracing` in our `Cargo.toml` with the feature.

Ref: <URL>

## Benefits

As mentioned above, enabling the `log` feature will allow us to observe logs emitted from, for example, `hyper`. This would be really helpful for debugging purposes especially when a user runs into an issue that we can't reproduce locally but can be reproduced in their environment. In this case, we can ask the user to run the program with `RUST_LOG=trace` or something and send us the logs that we can then examine to figure out what was going wrong.

Let's take a quick example to illustrate the point. The program to run is:

```The code snippet is an asynchronous fetch request to a URL using `await`.```

In Deno v1.45.5 with `RUST_LOG=h2=debug`, we see no output:

```The code snippet sets the Rust log level to debug for the h2 module and then uses Deno to evaluate a JavaScript expression that performs an HTTP request using the `fetch` API.```

But if we enable the `log` feature, the output is like this:

```The log shows the HTTP/2 client connection process initiated by Deno. It includes the following key events:

- Binding and confirming the client connection.
- Sending initial settings and window update frames.
- Sending a request with headers and receiving corresponding settings and window updates from the server.
- Receiving data from the server.
- Closing the connection with a GoAway frame indicating no error.```

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""logging"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the applied patches.

First, let's look at the issue title: ""Enable `log` feature of `tracing` crate."" This suggests that the problem is about enabling a logging feature in the tracing crate. The goal here seems to be integrating tracing logs with the existing logging system.

The body explains that they're using `log` and `env_logger`, which are standard Rust logging tools. However, some third-party crates like `hyper` use `tracing` for logging instead of `log`. By default, `tracing` doesn't emit logs in a way that's compatible with `env_logger`. Enabling the `log` feature in `tracing` would allow these logs to be captured by their existing setup. This makes debugging easier because they can ask users to provide logs using `RUST_LOG`.

The patches provided show adding `tracing` as a dependency and enabling the `log` feature. They also add filters for specific modules, like suppressing certain verbose logs from other crates. These changes are all about integrating and managing logging behavior.

The label assigned is ""logging."" Since the issue revolves around enhancing how logs from third-party crates are captured using `tracing` with the `log` feature, it fits perfectly under the logging category. The patches modify dependencies and logging configurations to achieve this integration, which directly relates to logging functionality.

So, yes, the label accurately reflects the issue's purpose.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Add sdpa choice for DeviceType::PrivateUse1"". This suggests they're adding a new feature or functionality, which aligns with an enhancement.

Next, the body of the issue explains that they want to extend PyTorch's support for DeviceType::PrivateUse1 by adding sdpa. They provided code snippets showing where changes are needed, specifically in handling different device types. This indicates they're introducing a new option or capability, which is typically what an enhancement entails.

Then, examining the patches applied. The first patch adds a new function `handle_private_use` that seems to handle the PrivateUse1 device type by calling `_fused_sdp_choice_stub`. In the second part of the patch, they modify the conditional statement to include DeviceType::PrivateUse1 and call this new function if that device is detected.

So, the patches are adding support for a new device type in an existing feature. Enhancements usually involve adding new functionalities or improving existing ones without fixing bugs. There's no indication here of a bug fix; instead, it's about extending the supported devices.

Therefore, the label ""enhancement"" fits because they're enhancing the code by adding support for another device type.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43070,runtime error,Root cause of errors is hidden when loading images from archive,Forward port of issue #43069 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Root cause of errors is hidden when loading images from archive."" This suggests that there's a problem where errors aren't being properly exposed or logged when trying to load images from an archive. So, the main issue here seems to be about error handling and visibility.

The body of the issue is pretty short; it just mentions a forward port of another issue (#43069) to version 3.4.x. That doesn't give me much detail, but I can assume that this is a known problem that's being addressed in a newer branch.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 shows changes in the load method. They replaced StreamCaptureUpdateListener with LoadImageUpdateListener and added an assertion to check for valid responses. This indicates they're improving how errors are captured and handled during image loading.

Patch 2 modifies the LoadImageUpdateEvent class by adding an ErrorDetail field, including a new constructor and getters. This means they're now capturing more detailed error information in the event, which helps in identifying what went wrong.

Patch 3 adds a new test case (loadWithErrorResponseThrowsException) that checks if an exception is thrown when an error response is received. This test ensures that the system correctly handles error scenarios by throwing appropriate exceptions with meaningful messages.

Patch 4 updates the test class to include a test for the ErrorDetail message, ensuring that when an event has an error detail, it's correctly retrieved and asserted. It also creates a sample JSON file (load-error.json) which likely contains an error message used in testing.

Putting this all together, the problem was that errors during image loading weren't being properly reported, making it hard to diagnose issues. The patches add better error handling by capturing detailed error information and ensuring that these errors are correctly thrown and tested.

So, does the label ""runtime error"" fit here? A runtime error typically refers to an exception or error that occurs during the execution of the program, as opposed to compile-time errors. In this case, the issue is about improving how runtime errors (specifically those occurring when loading images) are handled and reported. The patches enhance error visibility, which directly relates to runtime behavior.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" seems appropriate because it accurately describes that the issue pertains to errors occurring during the execution of the program when loading images from an archive.

### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.

when i compile by riscv32-unknown-elf-g++ compiler, get the below error:

```The log indicates a warning and an error during the compilation process using Cargo. The error occurs when trying to serialize an `int` object using the `Serialize` function from the `serialize.h` header file. Specifically, the error message suggests that the `Serialize` member function is being called on a `const int` object, which is not valid. This issue arises through a chain of include files and function calls starting from `hash.h`, `interpreter.h`, `interpreter.cpp`, and ultimately `serialize.h`.```

This error is caused by the logic in the SignatureHash function within src/script/interpreter.cpp. The function serializes the data to obtain a hash value, but it fails to find a serialization method for the int type.

```The code snippet appends `nHashType` to `ss`.```
This behavior is particularly strict in environments like RISC-V, where the ABI (Application Binary Interface) might enforce more rigid type distinctions, leading to errors during compilation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down what's in the issue and the solution patches.

The title is ""Risczero Fit"", which probably refers to support for RISC-V architecture, specifically riscv32-unknown-elf-g++. The body describes a feature request where compiling with this compiler results in an error related to serialization of an int type. The user provided the specific error message from the build process.

Looking at the patches, I see two changes:
1. In CTransactionSignatureSerializer, `int{0}` is changed to `int32_t{0}`.
2. The function SignatureHash has its parameter nHashType changed from `int` to `int32_t`.

So both changes are about type definitions in the code. The problem arises during compilation because of type mismatches or incorrect serialization methods for certain types, which caused the compiler to throw an error.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". I think this makes sense because the issue was triggered by the compiler (specifically when using riscv32-unknown-elf-g++), and the solution involved changing variable types to make the code compatible with that compiler. The problem wasn't about a bug in the functionality but rather about the build process failing due to type issues.

Therefore, the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue report.

As an aside, when is the special argument for `:help shellescape()` needed?  ",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""shellescaping of :! versus :term"". This suggests that the problem is about how shellescape is handled differently between two commands in Vim, namely `:!cmd` and `:term cmd`. The user is asking about whether this behavior is properly documented in the help files for these commands.

The body of the issue reinforces this. It mentions that when a file path is passed to `:!cmd`, shellescape is needed, whereas with `:term cmd path`, it's not. The user is specifically asking how this is documented in the respective help sections (`:help :!` and `:help :term`). They also have an aside about when shellescape() is needed, which again points towards documentation.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 seems to modify some internal files, adding new entries like term++shell and terminal-nospecial. This suggests that the help documentation for these features is being updated or added.

Patch 2 adds a section in terminal.txt explaining how Vim handles commands when using `:term ++shell`. It details that Vim itself doesn't process special characters except as noted, and refers to using the term++shell option, which relates directly to how shellescape might be handled. Additionally, it updates the help documentation for `:term` with more detailed explanations.

Patch 3 modifies various.txt, specifically the section about `:!{cmd}`. It explains in detail how Vim constructs the command line, considering options like 'shell', 'shcf', 'sxq', and 'shq'. It also notes that all cmdline-special characters are replaced before passing to the shell, which ties into shellescape handling.

Putting this together, the issue is about ensuring proper documentation of how shellescaping works in different commands. The patches add new sections and clarify existing ones in the help files. Therefore, the label ""documentation"" fits because the changes address documenting these behaviors rather than fixing a bug or introducing a new feature.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40122,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Gradle Enterprise Conventions 0.0.16,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Gradle Enterprise Conventions 0.0.16"". This clearly indicates that the purpose is to update a dependency, specifically moving from version 0.0.16-SNAPSHOT to 0.0.16. The mention of ""upgrade"" in the title already points towards a version change.

Next, examining the body of the issue: it's empty. There's no additional description provided beyond the title. However, since the patches are included, I can infer that the main action was changing the dependency version without any extra context or explanation needed.

Now, looking at the patch provided. It shows a change in the build.gradle file where the plugin version for ""io.spring.ge.conventions"" is updated from 0.0.16-SNAPSHOT to 0.0.16. This directly points to an upgrade of a dependency. The SNAPSHOT version typically denotes a development or unstable release, so moving to a non-SNAPSHOT version likely means it's now stable.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Considering the title explicitly mentions an upgrade and the patch shows a version update, this label fits perfectly. There's no indication that this change was for a new feature, bug fix, or any other type of issue. It solely focuses on updating a dependency to a newer version.

Therefore, after evaluating all parts—the title, body, and patches—it's clear that ""dependency upgrade"" is the correct label for this issue.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ui"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Blank screen when searching for a note and switching phone off and on again."" This suggests that after performing certain actions, the app displays a blank screen instead of the expected content. That sounds like a UI-related problem because the user interface isn't rendering correctly.

Next, reading the body of the issue, it describes a series of steps leading to the blank screen. The user searches for a note, opens it, turns their phone off and on, and ends up with a blank screen. Additionally, when they try editing and attaching an image, the same problem occurs—blank screen and unattached image. These are all issues related to how the app's interface is behaving under specific conditions, which points towards a UI bug.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

Patch 1 modifies the NotesScreenComponent by adding lines that prevent certain refresh actions if the parent type is 'Search'. This seems to be addressing how the component handles state changes, particularly related to searching. Since the problem occurs during search and navigation, this patch is tweaking UI-related behavior.

Patch 2 updates the appReducer to set the notesParentType when navigating to a specific route ('Search') and adds logging for debugging. This indicates that the issue was related to how the app's state manages different views or routes, which directly affects the user interface when switching between screens like the Search screen.

Putting this all together: The problem is about unexpected UI behavior (blank screen) under certain user actions and navigation. The patches address state management in components and reducers tied to search functionality and route navigation, both of which are integral parts of the user interface.

So, the label ""ui"" accurately reflects that the issue pertains to the app's interface not displaying content correctly. Therefore, I agree with assigning this label.

The issue revolves around unexpected UI behavior (blank screen) triggered by specific actions and navigation. Patches addressed state management in components affecting search functionality and route navigation, which are part of the UI.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""metadata"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the problem described in the issue.

The title is ""Missing optimized MIR for an item."" The body includes some Rust code examples and error messages when compiling. From what I remember, MIR stands for Mid-level Intermediate Representation in Rust, which is part of the compiler's optimization process. So, if there's a missing optimized MIR, it suggests that the compiler isn't generating the necessary optimizations, leading to errors.

Looking at the console output, the error mentions ""missing optimized MIR for an item in the crate `a`."" The note suggests checking if the crate was compiled with `--emit=metadata`. That flag is related to emitting metadata, which is used for things like incremental compilation and other compiler optimizations. So, maybe the issue is about how the metadata is handled when compiling crates.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue. Patch 1 modifies some code in ReachableContext, adding a condition where if an expression is a closure, it's considered reachable. This seems to affect how certain closures are processed by the compiler, perhaps ensuring their MIR is generated correctly.

Patch 2 adds a new static variable K with similar structure to A, involving inline attributes on functions and closures. This might be testing or fixing cases where inlined closures were causing issues with MIR generation.

Patch 3 updates some static variables and includes the new K variable in main() calls, which again seems like it's testing whether the MIR for these items is correctly handled after the fix.

Putting this together, the issue was that certain items (like functions or closures) weren't having their optimized MIR generated when they should have been. The error message points to metadata emission as a potential cause, implying that without the right metadata, the compiler couldn't find the necessary MIR information.

The label assigned is ""metadata."" Does this make sense? Well, the problem revolves around whether the crate was compiled with `--emit=metadata` and whether the MIR for certain items was missing because of it. The patches seem to adjust how closures are marked as reachable, which affects metadata emission, thus ensuring that optimized MIRs are generated.

Therefore, the ""metadata"" label accurately reflects the issue because the problem is tied to how metadata is emitted during compilation, affecting the availability of optimized MIR for certain items.
</think>

The label ""metadata"" accurately captures the essence of the issue, which relates to the emission of metadata affecting MIR generation.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40124,configuration,Make it harder to misconfigure logging.threshold.console in yaml,"This was found using Spring Boot 3.2.4 and Java 21.  Seems related to #36741.  

### Steps to reproduce
1. Build jar for any Spring Boot app that is using the default logging setup - i.e. spring-boot-starter-logging with no logback.xml or other config files, just `logging.*` properties set in application.yml.
2. Set `logging.threshold.console` to ""off"" in application.yml or application-{profile}.yml:

3. Run app: `java -jar path/to/app.jar`

### Expected result
Only Spring banner printed to console, all logging goes to log file (if configured).

### Actual result
All logging appears on console.

### Observations
Running the app with this command instead produces expected result, with or without the same set in application.yml:
`java -Dlogging.threshold.console=off -jar path/to/app.jar`

Not sure if this could be relevant, but I noticed that the `start()` method is called directly on the `ThresholdFilter`, rather than using `config.start(filter)`:
<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Make it harder to misconfigure logging.threshold.console in yaml"". This suggests that the issue is about how configuration settings are handled, specifically related to YAML configuration files. The title mentions a specific configuration property (logging.threshold.console) which indicates that this is a configuration-related problem.

Next, the body of the issue describes steps to reproduce the problem involving setting a particular value in application.yml and observing unexpected behavior. It also references another issue (#36741), which might be related but doesn't change the fact that this issue is about configuration settings not behaving as expected. The user provided an example YAML snippet, which again points to configuration.

The actual result is that logging appears on the console even when it's supposed to be turned off. They also mention a workaround using a system property instead of the YAML setting, implying that the problem lies in how configurations are being processed. The observation about the ThresholdFilter method suggests a code issue, but the context remains within configuration handling.

Looking at the patches applied: Patch 1 modifies how system properties related to logging thresholds are set by introducing a mapper function (thresholdMapper). This function converts ""false"" to ""OFF"", which directly affects how the YAML configurations are interpreted. The test cases in Patch 2 also focus on ensuring that setting ""false"" for console or file thresholds correctly maps to ""OFF"".

So, both patches are about handling configuration properties correctly and ensuring that the system behaves as expected when certain values are set in YAML files.

The label ""configuration"" accurately reflects that this issue is about how logging configurations are processed, particularly the YAML settings. The problem was due to improper handling of configuration values, and the solution involved modifying how these configurations map to internal system properties.

microsoft/vscode,228681,ui,"In `TEST RESULTS` panel, long line are not automatically wrapped","






Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: probably I don't know how to generate a test result without an extension



- VS Code Version: 1.93.1
- OS Version: OSX Darwin arm64 23.5.0

Long lines in `TEST RESULTS` panel are not wrapped automatically. User need to resize the panel for it to happen:

<URL>

Line should be wrapped automatically like it happens for console output.
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""ui"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me read through the title and body of the issue report to understand what it's about. The title says, ""In `TEST RESULTS` panel, long lines are not automatically wrapped."" That makes sense—it seems like a problem with how text is displayed in the Test Results panel. Specifically, when there are long lines, they don't wrap on their own, which can be annoying for users because it requires resizing the panel manually.

Looking at the body, the user mentions that without an extension, they're not sure how to generate test results, but they've provided a screenshot link. They also compare this behavior to the console output, where lines do wrap automatically. So their point is that the Test Results panel should behave similarly.

Now, let's look at the patches made to resolve this issue. The code changes are in a file related to the TestResultsViewContent class. It looks like they're adjusting how the layout is handled. Before, there was a check on dimension and setting topFrame.height based on provider.layout with just the dimension. Now, they added a width parameter that's retrieved from SubView.Diff, and they pass both width and height (from this.dimension?.height) to the provider.layout method.

This seems like it's adjusting how the layout is calculated for the Test Results panel, ensuring that when the width changes, the content wraps correctly. So, it's about improving the user interface by making text wrap automatically without needing manual resizing.

The label assigned here was ""ui"". I think UI issues generally relate to the visual elements and user interactions within the application. Since this problem is about how text appears in a panel and how it wraps, which affects the user experience directly, labeling it as ""ui"" makes sense. It's not a bug in the functionality but rather in the presentation.

I don't see any other more specific labels mentioned here, like ""ux"" or ""layout"", so ""ui"" seems appropriate because it's about the interface's behavior regarding text wrapping.
</think>

The label ""ui"" accurately reflects the issue since it pertains to the user interface's text wrapping functionality in the Test Results panel. The changes made affect how the UI handles layout and display, directly impacting user experience.

microsoft/vscode,212904,settings,Shared process should have a clone of all profile storages,"Discovered from <URL>

At present when syncing a profile, Settings gets snapshot of each profile storage from main and discards the snapshot as soon as the sync is finished. On an average, settings sync syncs all profiles once per 5 minutes. This means, every 5 minutes settings sync reads all profiles storages from main. 

Ref: <URL>

Instead

- get profile storage from main when needed for the first time
- from there on sync the storage from main using listeners - incrementally update the profile storage
",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""settings"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Shared process should have a clone of all profile storages."" This suggests that the problem is about how profile storages are handled in a shared process environment. The term ""profile storages"" likely refers to where user profiles are stored and managed.

Now, the body of the issue explains that currently, when syncing a profile, the settings take snapshots from the main storage and discard them after sync. This happens every 5 minutes, which is inefficient because it reads all profiles each time. The proposed solution is to get the profile storage on first need and then use listeners for incremental updates. So, this seems related to how user data profiles are synced and managed across processes.

The patches provided are a bit technical, but I can see that they involve changing imports from NativeUserDataProfileStorageService to SharedProcessUserDataProfileStorageService. This indicates a shift towards using a shared process approach for handling profile storages. There's also modification in the constructors, adding parameters like persistStorages and managing storage services with DisposableMap. The code changes aim at reusing existing storage instances instead of creating new ones each time, which aligns with the problem described.

The label assigned is ""settings."" I need to determine if this label captures the essence of the issue. Settings usually refer to user preferences or application configurations. While profile storages might include settings, the issue seems broader—it's about the underlying storage mechanism for profiles, not just the settings themselves. The problem affects how data is synced and stored across shared processes, which could impact multiple aspects beyond just user settings.

Moreover, looking at the patches, they modify services related to user data profiles and storage management. These changes are more foundational, dealing with how storages are initialized, managed, and disposed of. They don't specifically target settings but rather the infrastructure supporting profile data synchronization.

Therefore, while ""settings"" might be a related area, it doesn't fully encapsulate the issue's focus on shared process handling of all profile storages. A more accurate label might be something like ""performance,"" ""architecture,"" or ""sync,"" as these better reflect the nature of the changes made.
</think>

The label ""settings"" does not accurately reflect this issue report because the problem and patches address broader storage management in a shared process environment, not just user settings.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""backup"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patch used to fix it.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""nightly br always occurs oom where restore 1M tables."" The term ""br"" is commonly associated with backup and restore operations in TiDB. So the title suggests an OOM (out-of-memory) issue during a restore process involving a large number of tables.

In the body, the user describes using a command line that starts with `tiup br:nightly`, which I know is related to TiDB's backup and restore tool. The context mentions 100,000 databases and over 1 million tables, indicating a stress test scenario. The error log shows an OOM event where the process (br) was killed due to memory constraints.

The patch provided modifies how incomplete ranges are fetched in the code. Specifically, it changes the initial capacity of a slice from `64*len(iter.items)` to just `len(iter.items)`, with a comment indicating that this reduces memory usage for a million ranges. This suggests that the issue was related to memory management during backup or restore operations.

Putting it all together: the problem occurs in the backup/restore process (br), specifically causing an OOM situation when handling a large number of tables. The patch addresses this by optimizing memory allocation, which directly ties into the backup and restore functionality.

Therefore, the label ""backup"" is appropriate because the issue is about a problem occurring during a backup or restore operation.
</think>

The label ""backup"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to an out-of-memory error during a restore process using TiDB's backup tool (br). The patches address memory management in this context, confirming the relevance of the label.

rust-lang/rust,130853,runtime error,Miscompile in the GVN transform,"

I tried this code:

```The code snippet defines an `unsafe` function `src` that dereferences a double pointer to check if the value remains unchanged after calling another `unsafe` function `unknown`. The `unknown` function sets a mutable static pointer to 1. In `main`, it prints the result of `src` by setting `SUSSY` to point to a mutable integer `s` and passing a reference to it to `src`.```

I expected to see this happen:

This should print `false`, as I believe this is DB under both Stacked and Tree borrows(according to MIRI).

Instead, this happened:

It returns `false` in Debug mode, and the GVN MIR pass makes `src()` unconditionally return `true` in Release mode.

```````The log shows that the `cargo miri run` command was executed to compile and run the `sus` project. The compilation was successful and produced a debuggable binary. The Miri runtime environment then executed the program, which returned `false`.```

```````The log shows that the `cargo` command was used to run the Rust project named `sus`. The compilation was successful and produced a release build optimized for performance. The build process took 0.31 seconds. After running the executable, the output was `true`.```

### Meta


Here's the MIR before the GVN pass:

`````The code snippet is a middle-end representation (MIR) of a Rust function named `src`, which takes a reference to a reference of an unsigned 8-bit integer (`&&u8`) and returns a boolean. The function performs the following steps:

1. Declares local variables.
2. Enters a scope and declares another variable.
3. In `bb0` basic block:
   - Copies the value from the dereferenced first reference into `_2`.
4. In `bb1` basic block:
   - Copies the value from the dereferenced second reference into `_4`.
   - Copies the value from `_2` into `_5`.
   - Compares `_4` and `_5` and stores the result in `_0`.
5. Dead storage of variables and returns `_0`.```

<details>

<summary>After</summary>

`````The code snippet is a middle-end representation (MIR) of a Rust function. It takes a reference to a `&u8` and returns a `bool`. The function involves copying values, using scopes, and handling potential unwinding. Key points include:

- Copies the value pointed to by `_1` into `_6`, then copies this value into `_2`.
- Branches to `bb1` where it live-allocates `_4` and `_5`, copies `_2` into both, sets `_0` to `true`, and then dead-lifts `_4` and `_5`.
- Returns `true` at the end.```

</details>

It would be justified to make `src()` return `true` if `_6` was dereferenced again in `bb1`, however, the write in `unknown()` shouldn't invalidate the actual pointer stored in `_1` if my understanding of Stacked Borrows is correct.


This is present in both Stable and Nightly.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue isn't directly provided, but from the context of the patches, it seems related to some kind of bug fix in Rust code. The patches show changes made to several functions, particularly closures in a file named slice_filter.rs. 

Now, focusing on the body and patches: There are multiple patches (33 to 36) that modify variables, conditionals, and control flow within these closure functions. For example, in variant_a's closure, there are changes to how variables like _14, _15, etc., are used, especially around comparison operations using Le (which I assume is a less-than or equal operator). Similarly, in variant_b's closure, the patches adjust variable assignments and the conditions in switchInt statements.

The key here is to understand what kind of bug these patches are fixing. Runtime errors typically occur during the execution of the program, such as crashes, null pointer exceptions, out-of-bounds access, etc. They often manifest when certain conditions aren't handled correctly at runtime.

Looking at the changes, it seems like they're altering conditional checks and variable assignments in a way that affects control flow. For example, replacing which variables are compared or changing how boolean values are determined. This could be fixing incorrect logic that was causing unexpected behavior during execution—like an infinite loop, incorrect results, or even crashes if the wrong path was taken.

If these patches correct conditions that were leading to incorrect states or exceptions when the code runs, then yes, it's a runtime error. If they're addressing issues like incorrect output without any crash, it might still fall under runtime behavior but not necessarily an error per se. However, given the complexity of the changes and their focus on control flow and comparisons, it's likely that these patches are fixing scenarios where the program was either crashing or producing incorrect results due to logical errors in conditions.

Moreover, since the issue is labeled as a runtime error, and considering the nature of the changes (adjusting conditionals and variable usages that affect execution paths), I agree that this label accurately reflects the problem being addressed.

microsoft/vscode,204346,out of bounds,Aux window: validate window bounds are on display bounds,"It seems that when restoring floating windows, we fail to ensure that the bounds are actually a valid location that is visible. On Windows at least this can result in floating windows being entirely hidden.

//cc @alexr00 ",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""out of bounds"" accurately reflects the issue described in these patches.

First, looking at the problem description, it seems that the issue is related to window states and ensuring they stay within monitor boundaries. The code changes involve functions that adjust window positions and sizes so they don't go beyond the screen edges, which makes sense as ""out of bounds"" refers to elements going beyond their intended limits.

In Patch 5, there's a method called `validateWindowState` being moved or modified. This function checks if the window state is within acceptable ranges and corrects it if not. The comments mention preventing windows from falling outside the screen, which aligns with the ""out of bounds"" concept.

The patches also adjust imports and exports to move this validation into a separate namespace, indicating that this functionality is being modularized or refactored for better organization. This doesn't change the core issue but shows ongoing maintenance related to preventing out-of-bounds window states.

Looking at other parts like Patches 6 and 7, they seem unrelated to window bounds. However, since the main focus of the changes is on the window state validation, those might be additional fixes in the same update but not directly tied to the label in question.

Considering all this, the ""out of bounds"" label seems appropriate because it directly relates to the problem of windows exceeding screen boundaries and the code changes made to address it.

The label ""out of bounds"" accurately reflects the issue as the patches address window states going beyond screen limits.

Okay, let me try to figure out if the label ""forward port"" is accurate for this issue. 

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Inconsistent double slashes in generated Javadoc URLs."" It seems like the problem is about incorrect URL formatting where there are extra slashes.

The body says it's a forward port of issue #43518 to 3.4.x. So, they're taking a fix from another version and applying it here. That makes sense for a ""forward port"" label because that's exactly what a forward port entails—moving changes to a different branch or version.

Now, looking at the patches: In multiple places, URLs are being changed by removing trailing slashes. For example, in Patch 1, they change from ""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/"" to ""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api"". Similarly, in other patches, like with AssertJ and ByteBuddy, the same pattern of removing trailing slashes is applied. So, the fix involves modifying URLs to eliminate double slashes or unnecessary trailing slashes.

Since all these changes are part of a forward port from another issue, applying them to the 3.4.x branch, the label ""forward port"" seems correct because it accurately describes that this issue was addressed by bringing over fixes from a previous version.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" is appropriate as the issue involves transferring fixes from a prior version to the current one.

Alright, I'm trying to determine whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Nightly aarch64 cuda builds are failing since 09.19.2024."" This clearly indicates that something is wrong with the builds on ARM architecture (aarch64) using CUDA. The use of ""failing"" suggests an unexpected problem, which aligns with a bug.

Next, examining the body of the issue. There's a link to a failed GitHub Action run, and a code snippet showing an internal compiler error in FlashAttentionKernel.cpp.SVE256.cpp. The error message mentions an internal compiler error during the RTL pass, specifically pointing to line 555 where a lambda function is defined. This kind of error is unexpected behavior from the compiler or the code, which fits the definition of a bug.

The user also references a recent pull request that was merged on September 18, 2024, titled ""Extending the Pytorch vec backend for SVE (ARM)."" This suggests that the issue might be related to changes introduced by this PR. Since it's a new feature or modification, any unexpected behavior here would still fall under a bug.

Looking at the patches provided, they modify several lines in the code where conditional checks are made against the compiler version and ARM features. The original condition checked for __GNUC__ == 11 and __GNUC_MINOR__ >=4 along with __ARM_FEATURE_SVE. The patch removes the minor version check, leaving it to just check for __GNUC__ ==11 and SVE support.

This change indicates that the bug was occurring because the code wasn't compatible with certain versions of the compiler when using ARM's SVE features. Adjusting these conditions likely resolved the internal compiler error, which confirms that this was a bug in how the code handled compiler versions or SVE features.

Considering all this, the issue is about unexpected and erroneous behavior in the code due to specific conditions not being handled correctly. This fits perfectly under the ""bug"" label.
</think>

The issue report describes an unexpected problem causing build failures related to recent changes, confirmed by patches adjusting compiler condition checks. The situation aligns with a bug.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""serialization"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Investigate getting all globals that need to be added to `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals` in one call rather than iteratively."" The title mentions `add_safe_globals`, which is part of the serialization module in PyTorch. This suggests that the issue revolves around the process of adding safe globals during deserialization.

Next, the body of the issue explains that currently, when loading a model with `torch.load()`, it might fail due to unsupported GLOBALs. The user has to iteratively add these globals using `add_safe_globals` until the load succeeds. The suggestion is to find all necessary globals in one go for efficiency. This again points towards serialization, as it's about handling pickle files and their global references.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a new function `get_unsafe_globals_in_checkpoint` to the documentation. This implies that a utility function was added to help identify problematic globals during deserialization.

Patch 2 introduces a test for this new function, ensuring it correctly identifies unsafe globals in a checkpoint. The test uses serialization methods and checks against expected global strings, further tying it to serialization.

Patch 3 modifies existing code related to reading pickle files. It adds the `get_globals_in_pkl` function, which parses the pickle data to extract GLOBAL instructions. This is core to how PyTorch handles deserialization of saved models.

Patch 4 updates the documentation and adds the public function `get_unsafe_globals_in_checkpoint`, which uses the new utility to find unsafe globals in a checkpoint file. This function's purpose is to help users identify all necessary globals upfront, improving the serialization process.

All patches are within files related to PyTorch's serialization mechanisms. They introduce tools to analyze and handle globalization during deserialization more effectively. The common thread across all changes is enhancing how the library manages global references when loading saved models, which falls under the umbrella of serialization.

Therefore, the label ""serialization"" accurately captures the essence of this issue report. It directly relates to improvements in handling global variables during the deserialization process, which is a key aspect of PyTorch's serialization functionality.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33421,concurrency,Deadlock between SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest when clients disconnect,"We have been tracking rather strange & random failures in our application: eventually, after many browser closed (and/or page refresh), our SSE event flux would not be sending anything anymore to new clients.

We identified that threads used for async tasks execution (AsyncSupportConfigurer) may deadlock due to a timing-dependant ABBA deadlock between SseEmitter sending and error handling on connection closed.
If using the the default SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor which fires up a new Thread for each task, no user visible effect (except that some deadlocked unused threads are consumming resources on the server).
But, if using a fixed number of threads (as we do in our application), the system may finally come to a halt (when all worker threads have been deadlocked).

What we think is going on (see example jstack trace captured): 
- The client is connected to the SSE endpoint:
- For an object to be written to the sse flux:
    - the SseEmitter locks itself (synchronized on super.send(...))
    - then the Object is serialized (Jackson)
    - eventually, writing/flushing on the output stream will require StandardServletAsyncWebRequest to aquire its stateLock ReentrantLock
- The client disconnects abruptly (browser closed), while the object is being serialized:
   - the server ""sees"" that the connection has been closed (probably because another object is sent concurrently on the SseEmitter)
   - this triggers StandardServletAsyncWebRequest.onError handling process that first locks the stateLock ReentrantLock and then calls SseEmitter.completeWithError which wants to lock itself (synchronized)
So, we think that there's a potential ABBA deadlock between SSE error handling and concurrent SSE sending. 

Things are highly timing dependent, but we have been able to reproduce (with high probablity) our observed deadlocks:
the idea is to emit big JSON objects (increasing the concurrency window) and normal objects concurrenty on the flux, while closing the browser

Reproduced with spring boot 3.3.2 (springframework 6.1.11) and also 3.3.3 (springframework 6.1.12)


Steps to reproduce:
=============

See the minimalist example attached, with the following steps to reproduce:

- Launch the main class
    - note the process PID for further reference
- Using a browser as an http client, go to the index.html via url : <URL>
- Refresh the browser
- Run the ""jstack $PID"" command
    - You should notice 1 deadlock (varying probability, but still very likely)
- For each additional refresh, an additional deadlock may appear

Example of deadlock captured using jstack:
=============================

```The log indicates a single Java-level deadlock involving two threads: ""http-nio-8080-exec-3"" and ""task-4"". 

- ""http-nio-8080-exec-3"" is waiting to acquire a lock on an `SseEmitter` object while holding a lock on a `DeferredResult`.
- ""task-4"" is waiting to acquire a lock on a `ReentrantLock` while holding a lock on the `DeferredResult`.

This results in a deadlock where each thread is waiting for the other to release its lock.```
[demodeadlock.zip](<URL>
",1,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the title and body of the issue. The title mentions a deadlock between SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest when clients disconnect. Deadlocks are typically related to concurrency issues because they occur when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource.

Looking at the body, it describes how under certain conditions with multiple browser refreshes and SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections, the application starts failing. They identified that this is due to an ABBA deadlock involving locks on SseEmitter and StandardServletAsyncWebRequest. The problem arises when threads involved in async tasks deadlock because of timing-dependent lock acquisition orders.

The steps to reproduce involve closing browsers abruptly, which likely causes the server to handle disconnections asynchronously, leading to concurrent access issues. They provided a jstack trace showing two threads waiting for each other's locks, a classic symptom of a deadlock caused by concurrency.

Now, looking at the patches. The main changes are in how locks are obtained. They introduced a method tryObtainLock() that uses a timeout and checks the state before acquiring the lock. This is meant to prevent deadlocks by avoiding indefinite waits and ensuring proper state transitions. Several methods were updated to use this new locking mechanism, replacing previous obtainLockAndCheckState calls.

The patches focus on modifying how locks are handled in asynchronous contexts, which directly relates to concurrency management. The goal is to prevent the deadlock scenario by improving lock acquisition with timeouts and better state checking.

Given that deadlocks, thread safety, and proper lock handling are all core aspects of concurrency issues, the label ""concurrency"" seems appropriate here. The problem described and the solution applied both pertain to how multiple threads interact and access shared resources without running into deadlock situations.

Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if the label ""workspace"" correctly reflects this GitHub issue report. The issue has a specific title and body, and there are two patches that resolved it.

First, looking at the title: It mentions an error related to the ""-mod"" flag when not in workspace mode. That immediately makes me think about how Go modules work, especially regarding workspace setups. So the problem seems tied to using the module system correctly.

The body of the issue shows that running govulncheck with version 1.0.2 causes an error about the ""-mod=mod"" flag. The user tried installing the latest version and encountered this problem. It looks like the tool was trying to run a command that requires workspace mode but wasn't in it, hence the error.

Now, looking at the patches. Patch 1 modifies how the 'go list' command is called. Instead of always using ""-mod=mod"", it checks if there's a ""vendor"" directory. If so, it uses ""-mod=readonly"". This adjustment seems to handle cases where the tool runs in a vendored module without being in workspace mode. The comment mentions go.dev/issue/65155 and 65124, which I assume are related to module handling and workspaces.

Patch 2 adds a new function 'fileExists' that checks if a file exists. This is used in Patch 1 to determine whether to adjust the command-line arguments for 'go list'. So the main change is about how modules are loaded when the tool runs, especially concerning vendor directories and workspace settings.

The assigned label is ""workspace"". Considering all this, the problem revolves around the tool's behavior when it's not run in a workspace but tries to use flags that require it. The patches fix this by adjusting module loading based on whether the code is in a vendored directory or not, thus avoiding the need for workspace mode when unnecessary.

So yes, the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the issue because it's about handling cases where the tool isn't in workspace mode and needs to adjust its module flags accordingly.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""failure"" correctly applies to this issue report. Let me start by understanding what's in the problem.

Looking at the title of the issue, it says: ""Add backoff [sic] for Azure Blob Storage when throttled"". So, the main goal here seems to be about adding a backoff mechanism, which I think is related to handling retries when there are throttle issues from Azure. Throttling usually means that the service is limiting the number of requests, so adding backoff would help in retrying those failed requests after some delay.

Now, looking at the patches provided, they seem to modify several files across different packages. Let me go through each patch and see what's being changed.

In Patch 1 (azure/blobcontainer.py), there are imports added for `time` and `random`, which makes sense because backoff typically involves waiting and retrying. Then, in the `AzureBlobContainer` class, a new constructor parameter `backoff` is added with a default of `None`. The `do_request` method now includes a loop that retries the request up to `max_retries` times if it gets a 429 (Too Many Requests) error. It uses exponential backoff by waiting for a random time between 0 and `2^attempt * factor` seconds.

So, this patch is clearly about adding retry logic with backoff when facing throttling from Azure.

Moving to Patch 9 (moved from azure package to http), there's a refactoring of the `ResponseInjectingHttpHandler` class. It seems that this handler is used in tests to simulate HTTP responses, including errors. The changes here are more about code structure and visibility, making some methods public and adjusting how request handlers are implemented.

In Patch 7 (test_azure_blob_container.py), a new test method `test_compare_and_exchange_when_throttled` is added. This test checks if the container correctly handles throttling by retrying the update operation. It sets up multiple throttling responses and verifies that the final state reflects the correct data after retries.

Other patches like 3,4,5,6,8 adjust similar retry logic with backoff in different parts of the codebase, ensuring that when a request is throttled (returns 429), it's retried with appropriate delays. They also modify test cases to simulate these scenarios and ensure the system behaves correctly under such conditions.

Putting this all together, the problem being addressed is how the application handles situations where Azure Blob Storage is throttling requests. Without proper backoff, the application might fail or not retry effectively. By adding exponential backoff with retries, it becomes more resilient against such issues.

The label ""failure"" is assigned to this issue. Now, does that make sense? The problem is about handling failures (specifically 429 errors) by implementing retries with backoff. So yes, the core of the issue is dealing with failure scenarios in network requests and ensuring reliable operation through retry mechanisms.

Therefore, I think the label ""failure"" accurately reflects this issue because it's primarily about handling situations where requests fail due to throttling and ensuring the system can recover from those failures.

spring-projects/spring-framework,32326,injection,Injection point using ObjectProvider should not apply bean by name fallback for orderedStream,"Consider an `ApplicationContext` with three instances of `TestBean` named: `testBean`, `anotherTestBean`, and `someTestBean` using the following injection point:

```The code snippet defines an `Example` class with a constructor that takes an `ObjectProvider<TestBean>` as a parameter. Inside the constructor, it calls the `orderedStream()` method on the `testBean` object and continues with some unspecified operations.```

Current `6.2.x` has a regression that it apparently applies the bean by name shortcut, resulting in a stream with a single instance (the one named `testBean`). Using `ConfigurableApplicationContext#getBeanProvider(TestBean.class)` works as expected and return the three configured instances.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""injection"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is: ""Injection point using ObjectProvider should not apply bean by name fallback for orderedStream."" Hmm, that sounds a bit technical, but I know it relates to dependency injection in Spring Framework since we're talking about ApplicationContext and TestBean instances.

Looking at the body, the user explains that when using an ObjectProvider to inject TestBeans, there's a regression where only one bean is returned instead of all three. They mention that the issue arises because the current code applies a bean by name shortcut, which isn't expected in this context. They also note that using getBean() directly works fine, so it's specific to how ObjectProvider is handling things.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are several changes in test files where method names and variable names related to ObjectProvider are being updated. For example, in one file, they change testBeanProvider to testBean and update the corresponding getter methods. In another part, they adjust the test cases to expect multiple beans instead of a single instance.

So, the problem seems to be about how dependency injection is handled when using ObjectProvider. The fix involves modifying the tests to correctly handle multiple bean instances and ensuring that the ObjectProvider doesn't fall back to a single bean by name when it shouldn't.

The label assigned was ""injection."" I'm trying to see if this makes sense. Dependency injection issues often relate to how objects are provided with their dependencies, which is exactly what's happening here. The problem is about how the ObjectProvider (which is part of the injection mechanism) is fetching beans, so it fits under dependency injection concerns.

I don't see any other obvious labels that would better fit this issue. It's not a bug in the UI or performance but specifically about how dependencies are injected using Spring's features. Therefore, the label ""injection"" accurately reflects the nature of the problem and its solution.
</think>

The label ""injection"" correctly captures the essence of the issue, which pertains to dependency injection mechanisms in Spring Framework.

### Severity

blocking an upgrade",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the issue says.

The title is about Svelte versions 4 and 5, mentioning that whitespaces are being rendered where there shouldn't be any, specifically referencing the &#xFEFFF; character. So this seems related to an upgrade from version 4 to 5 because the user encountered a new bug after moving to Svelte 5.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user describes a bug where whitespace characters appear between elements when they shouldn't. They provided images and a reproduction repository. The steps involve creating a new project with Svelte 5 preview, which indicates it's about an upgrade scenario. They also mention that this is blocking their upgrade, which suggests it's a significant issue preventing them from moving to the newer version.

Now, considering the patches applied: Patch 1 mentions stripping the BOM (Byte Order Mark) character from input. Patches 2 and 3 show code changes where functions like compile, compileModule, and parse now include removing the BOM by checking if the source starts with &#xFEFF; and slicing it off if present. There's also a test added to ensure this fix works.

So the issue arises when upgrading from Svelte 4 to 5, causing unexpected whitespace due to the BOM character. The patches specifically target this problem by removing the BOM at the start of the source. This means the bug is directly tied to the upgrade process and the behavior changes between versions.

The label ""upgrade"" was assigned, which seems appropriate because the issue occurs during the transition from an older version (4) to a newer one (5). The problem wasn't present before upgrading, so it's indeed an upgrade-related issue. 

Therefore, I agree that the label accurately reflects the report.

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""conflict resolution"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that fixed it.

First, let me read through the issue details again. The title is about editing notes in the ""Conflicts"" folder causing them to temporarily disappear. The user provided steps to reproduce: opening a note from Conflicts, modifying it, and then seeing it vanish until they navigate away and back. They expected that the note shouldn't disappear while being edited.

Looking at the patches, I see several changes. Patch 1 modifies the function `formNoteToNote` to include `is_conflict`. It seems like this function now returns a `NoteEntity` with the `is_conflict` property set from `formNote.is_conflict`.

Patch 2 adds an optional `is_conflict` field to the `FormNote` interface. So now, when a form note is created or updated, it can carry whether it's in conflict.

Patch 3 introduces a test case that checks if `is_conflict` is preserved when saving the note. It mocks a note with `is_conflict: 1`, uses the `formNoteToNote` function, and expects the resulting note to have `is_conflict: 1`.

Patch 4 updates the `useFormNote` hook to include `n.is_conflict` in the form note, ensuring that this property is correctly passed around.

Putting it all together, the issue was that when editing a conflict note, it would disappear because somewhere in the code, the `is_conflict` flag wasn't being handled properly. The patches ensure that when converting between form notes and actual notes, the conflict status isn't lost. This way, the UI knows not to remove the note from the list when edited.

So the problem was related to handling conflicts correctly—specifically, making sure that notes marked as conflicts don't get removed or lose their status during editing. Therefore, the label ""conflict resolution"" fits because it's about properly managing and preserving conflict states in the application.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue, which involved preserving the conflict state when editing notes to prevent them from disappearing.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Gradle Plugin AOT documentation has sample error."" This immediately suggests that there's an issue with the documentation related to the Gradle Plugin for Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation in Spring Boot.

Next, the body of the issue includes a link to the specific documentation page and an image screenshot. The user provided a URL and an attached image, which likely points out where the error is in the documentation. Since I can't view the image directly, but based on context, it's safe to assume that it highlights an error or incorrect information in the docs.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. The patch shows changes made to a file, specifically removing some lines related to Groovy and Kotlin examples. It seems like the problematic part of the documentation was an example that had errors, so those sections were removed or corrected.

The label assigned is ""documentation."" Considering all these points—the title mentions documentation error, the body provides context about where the error is, and the patches involve modifying the documentation content—it's clear that the issue pertains to a problem in the documentation. 

There’s no indication that this issue relates to a bug in the codebase or a feature request. It's strictly about correcting an error in the provided examples within the documentation. Therefore, the label ""documentation"" is appropriate and accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression means in software terms. A regression typically refers to a bug or unintended behavior that appears after a change was made to the codebase, especially when upgrading versions or introducing new features.

Looking at the issue report's title: ""[Android] borderRadius & border(Top|Right|LeftBottom)Color='transparent' don't work properly together."" The user is reporting an issue specific to Android where certain border properties aren't rendering correctly when some are set to transparent and others have colors. This behavior wasn't present in a previous version of React Native, specifically after upgrading from 0.74.3 to 0.76.2.

The body of the report mentions that the problem started after bumping the React Native version, which implies that the bug was introduced by an update. They also provided steps to reproduce and examples showing different behaviors on iOS versus Android, confirming it's platform-specific.

The patches provided are from two separate files in the repository. Both changes modify conditions related to when borders should be clipped based on their colors' alpha values. The original condition required all border colors to be non-transparent (using &&), which was causing issues when some were transparent and others weren't. The fix changed this to check if any of the colors are non-transparent (using ||), ensuring that borders render correctly even with mixed transparent and colored edges.

Since the issue arose after an upgrade, it's a regression because the change introduced unintended behavior compared to previous versions. The patches address this by adjusting how border rendering conditions are evaluated, fixing the bug without reverting other changes.

- Lightbulb for SA1006 worked (except the duplicated code actions).
- Lightbulb for printf analysis is not present.

### Traces

It looks like VS Code triggers code actions in different ways. 
<URL>

1) Light bulb on editor

VS Code sent a request asking for quick fixes for detected problems. (See ""context"" filled with the diagnostic&its source, and `triggerKind:2` (TriggerKind: ""Automatic""). Gopls returned ""inline call to Fprintln"" code action, which doesn't make sense.

```The log shows a code action request sent for file `main.go` at line 291, character 1, due to a diagnostic related to a redundant newline in a `fmt.Fprintln` call. The response provides a refactor suggestion to inline the call to `Fprintln`.```

Note that VS Code asked quick fixes for ""printf"" analyzer, but not for SA1006 analyzer's report. This can be a client-side issue and I will investigate it separately.

2) Hover on editor

VS Code sent the request asking for quick fixes for detected problems. (See ""context"" filled with the diagnostic&its source, and `triggerKind:1` (TriggerKind ""Invoked""). Gopls returned nothing.

```The log shows that a code action request was sent for the file `main.go` at line 291, character 1 to 43. The request was triggered by a diagnostic message indicating that the `fmt.Fprintln` call has a redundant newline at the end of its argument list. The response to this request returned `null`.```

3) Light bulb on PROBLEMS panel

VS Code sent request with ""quickfix"" and ""triggerKind: 1"". Gopls returned some code actions for SA1006 diagnostic (but with duplications)

```The log shows a code action request sent at 10:46:11.180 AM for file `/Users/hakim/projects/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry/main.go` at line 162, character 1 to 53. The request was triggered by a diagnostic message indicating that `fmt.Fprintf` should be replaced with `fmt.Fprint` due to the use of a printf-style function with a dynamic format string and no additional arguments. The server responded with two identical quickfix suggestions to replace `fmt.Fprintf` with `fmt.Fprint`, both pointing to the same range in the code and proposing the same edit.```

But didn't return codeactions for printf diagnostic.

```The log shows that a code action request was sent for the file `main.go` at line 291, character 1 to 43. The request was triggered by a diagnostic message indicating that the `fmt.Fprintln` call has a redundant newline at the end of its argument list. The response to this request returned `null`, indicating no actions were available or suggested.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this issue report. Let me read through everything carefully.

The issue seems to be about a problem with code actions not showing up as expected in VS Code when using gopls. The user provided several patches that were made to fix the issue. From what I understand, the main problem was related to how code actions were being handled, specifically with the 'quickfix' kind and ensuring they appear correctly under certain conditions.

Looking at the title of the report: ""gopls doesn't return quickfixes when using triggerkind=invoked."" That sounds like a bug because it's describing unexpected behavior—gopls isn't returning the expected actions when it should be. 

The body explains that gopls wasn't correctly handling code actions, leading to missing quick fixes in certain UI contexts. The provided patches modify how these code actions are bundled and retrieved, indicating that there was a flaw in the previous implementation.

The label ""bug"" is assigned here, which makes sense because it's about fixing an unintended behavior. All the patches seem aimed at correcting this issue rather than adding new features or improvements. Therefore, I agree with the label.

rust-lang/rust,123712,vector,String::to_lowercase does not get vectorized well contrary to code comments,"I'm looking into the performance of `to_lowercase` / `to_uppercase`on mostly ascii strings, using a small microbenchmark added to `library/alloc/benches/string.rs`. 

```This Rust code snippet defines a benchmark function `bench_to_lowercase` that measures the performance of converting a given string to lowercase using the `to_lowercase` method. The string is defined within the function and passed to `b.iter`, which iterates over the operation to be benchmarked.```

Using linux perf tooling I see that the hot part of the code is the following large loop, which despite heavy use of sse2 instructions only seems to process 32 bytes per iteration.

```The code snippet is an assembly routine that processes data using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations with XMM registers. It involves loading data from memory, shuffling and manipulating vectors, and storing results back to memory. Key operations include:

- Loading data into XMM registers.
- Using shuffle instructions (`pshufd`) to rearrange vector elements.
- Logical and bitwise operations (`andpd`, `pand`, `por`, `psrlq`, `psllq`).
- Vector arithmetic (`packuswb`, `paddb`, `pminub`).
- Storing results back to memory.

The code iterates over a block of data, processing it in chunks and updating pointers as it progresses.```

I don't see an easy way to improve the autovectorization of this code, but it should be relatively easy to explicitly vectorize it using `portable_simd`, and I would like to prepare such a PR if there are no objections. As far as I know, `portable_simd` is already in use inside `core`, for example by #103779.",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to determine whether the label ""vector"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break down each part to understand better.

First, looking at the title: it seems to be about improving the autovectorization of a specific function in Rust's standard library, probably related to string case conversion like `to_lowercase` or similar. The mention of SIMD instructions suggests that vector operations are involved here.

Now, reading through the body of the issue, it talks about modifying functions to improve their performance by leveraging auto-vectorization. Auto-vectorization is a compiler technique where loops are automatically converted into vectorized code, which can run more efficiently on modern CPUs with SIMD capabilities. The user provided patches that change how certain string operations process ASCII bytes, aiming for better vectorization.

Looking at the patches, especially Patch 2 and Patch 4, there's a focus on processing chunks of data (like 16 bytes) to enable auto-vectorization. They use techniques such as checking all bytes in a chunk are ASCII using SIMD-friendly methods, which helps the compiler generate more efficient code. The tests added also check for specific vectorized instructions in the generated code, like loading 16 bytes and performing operations on them.

The label ""vector"" is typically used to indicate issues related to SIMD or vectorization optimizations. Given that the problem revolves around enhancing auto-vectorization for performance gains, this label seems appropriate. It accurately captures the essence of the changes made, which are all about improving how the code uses vectorized instructions to process data in chunks.

So, putting it all together: the issue is indeed about vector optimization through better auto-vectorization techniques, and the patches reflect that by restructuring the code to work in fixed-size chunks conducive to SIMD processing. Therefore, the label ""vector"" accurately describes this issue.

Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if the label ""hover"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue report. 

First, looking at the issue title: ""[Termdebug] balloon display evaluation of variable under mouse doesn't work."" It mentions that when hovering over a variable with the mouse in Termdebug, nothing happens. So the problem is about the hover functionality not working as expected.

In the body, the steps to reproduce involve hovering the mouse over a variable at a breakpoint, and nothing happening. The expected behavior was that it should work, which it did in previous versions. This again points to an issue with the hover feature.

Now looking at the patch provided. It changes the condition from checking for ""+balloon_eval"" or ""+balloon_eval_term"" features to just ""balloon_eval"" and ""balloon_eval_term"". This suggests that the fix was related to how Vim's balloon evaluation is being checked, which directly affects whether the hover display works.

So putting it all together: The issue is about a problem with hovering over variables not showing the expected balloon information. The patch corrects the condition that enables this feature. Therefore, labeling this as ""hover"" makes sense because the core of the problem is the malfunctioning hover functionality in Termdebug.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue, which is specifically about the hover functionality not working.

pytorch/pytorch,127043,bug,[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for torch.addr not checking for errors,"Discovered with <URL>

Original repro: `PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_DYNAMO=1 pytest test/test_linalg.py::TestLinalgCPU::test_addr_float_and_complex_cpu_float16`

Minimal repro:
```The code imports the `torch` library and defines a function `f` that attempts to use `torch.addr` to perform a specific tensor operation. If an exception occurs, it returns `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns the result of the operation. The function is then compiled using `torch.compile` with the ""eager"" backend. Finally, the compiled function `opt_f` is called with random tensor inputs.```

Output:
```The log shows that the script `playground3.py` traced and compiled a graph for a function `f`. The function takes three arguments `L_m_`, `L_a_`, and `L_b_` and uses them to compute a result using `torch.addr` with `beta=True` and `alpha=2`. The compilation process did not encounter any issues during tracing but failed at runtime due to an error stating that the `Boolean beta` parameter is only supported for Boolean results, which is incompatible with the use of `beta=True` in the `torch.addr` function call.```

It looks like this error occurs because the fake tensor implementation for torch.addr isn't performing all the necessary error checks.

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[dynamo] Fake tensor impl for torch.addr not checking for errors."" This suggests that there's an issue with how Dynamo handles error checks in the `torch.addr` function when using fake tensors. The word ""not checking"" implies something is wrong or missing, which typically points to a bug.

Next, examining the body of the issue. The user provided a minimal reproducible example and the resulting error message: ""RuntimeError: Boolean beta only supported for Boolean results."" This indicates that when `beta` is set to a boolean (like True), the function expects the result to be a boolean tensor, which isn't the case here. The fake tensor implementation in Dynamo didn't catch this error, leading to incorrect behavior.

The patches provided also shed light on what was fixed. Patch 1 removes an xfailIfTorchDynamo decorator from a test method, meaning that test was previously failing but now should pass because the issue is resolved. This suggests that the problem was related to Dynamo not handling certain cases correctly.

Patch 2 adds explicit error checks in the `addr` function for boolean values of `alpha` and `beta`. It verifies if the data types support these booleans, ensuring that errors are caught before execution. These new checks prevent the RuntimeError by validating inputs earlier.

Putting it all together: The issue describes unexpected behavior (a runtime error) due to missing error checks in Dynamo's implementation. The patches fix this by adding necessary validations and adjusting tests. This fits the definition of a bug because it's an unintended flaw in the code that causes incorrect behavior.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it involved incorrect behavior due to missing error checks, which was fixed with appropriate validations.

ziglang/zig,20305,target,`std.os.linux.start_pie` is missing support for `powerpc64le`,"### Zig Version

0.13.0

### Steps to Reproduce and Observed Behavior

```The log shows that attempting to build an executable with the `powerpc64-linux` target using Zig version 0.13.0 results in two errors:
1. A missing `R_RELATIVE` definition for the target.
2. PIE (Position Independent Executable) startup is not supported for the `powerpc64-linux` target.```

### Expected Behavior

No compile error.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""target"" correctly reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""`std.os.linux.start_pie` is missing support for `powerpc64le`"". This tells me that there's a problem with the `start_pie.zig` file not supporting the powerpc64le target. The user tried to compile a Zig program using `-target powerpc64-linux` and encountered errors.

In the body, the error messages mention missing R_RELATIVE definitions and PIE startup support for the target. This indicates that when targeting powerpc64le, the necessary constants and assembly code weren't present in the `start_pie.zig` file.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a new constant `R_PPC_RELATIVE = 22;`. It also updates the switch statement to include `.powerpc`, `.powerpcle`, `.powerpc64`, and `.powerpc64le` cases, assigning them this new relative value. This directly addresses the missing R_RELATIVE definition error.

Patch 2 introduces assembly code blocks for powerpc, powerpcle, powerpc64, and powerpc64le targets. These additions provide the necessary low-level code to handle PIE startup on these architectures, which was previously unsupported and causing the compile errors.

So both patches modify `start_pie.zig` by adding support specifically for PowerPC targets. The label ""target"" is used in the context of software development often to refer to specific CPU architectures or platforms that the code needs to be compiled for. Since these changes are all about enabling support for a new target architecture (powerpc64le), the label ""target"" seems appropriate.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, and the issue is clearly about adding support for a particular target. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem and its solution.

v0.122.0 works without errors. Is this due to the [breaking changes](#11455) in v0.123.0 or is it a regression?

Thanks for your hard work!",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""build"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""ERROR TOCSS: failed to transform file after v0.123.1"". This suggests there's an error related to transforming a file, possibly during the build process since TOCSS is involved in processing CSS/SCSS files.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. The user is encountering two build failures. The first error is about failing to transform an SCSS file due to an undefined variable. This seems like a build-time error because it's happening when compiling or transforming assets during the site generation. The second error is a reference not found, which could relate to broken shortcodes or missing content, but again, this is causing a build failure.

The user also mentions that version 0.122.0 works fine without errors, implying that something changed in 0.123.0 or 0.123.1 that introduced these issues. They’re asking if it's due to breaking changes or a regression, which indicates they suspect a problem with the build process.

Now looking at the patches applied. Patch 1 skips a test related to config parameters on language level, which might be a workaround for a failing test, possibly caused by the same underlying issue. Patch 2 modifies how source paths are handled in the resource transformation context. It trims the prefix of the input path, which could fix issues with how files are being processed during the build.

Putting it all together, both errors mentioned are occurring during the build process (CI run) and the patches seem to address issues that affect the successful completion of builds. The label ""build"" is appropriate because it's directly related to problems arising when generating or compiling the site, which falls under build issues.
</think>

The issue report describes build failures during CI runs, and the patches address problems in the build process. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content.

NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra,6528,bug,Decompiler erroneously swapping operators without changing the operand in floating-point comparisons where data is marked constant (x86),"**Describe the bug**
When a float variable is being compared with a double variable using one of the FCOM instructions, if the double is made constant, the comparator will flip directions, rendering the comparison incorrect.

For example:

```The code snippet checks if `x` is less than `const_1.5`. If true, it returns 0.```

will become

```The code checks if `x` is greater than 1.5 and returns 0 if true.```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Load the attached binary (I used x86:LE:32:default)
2. Make the value at address 0x0 a double
3. Make the value at address 0x8 a float
4. Observe the decompiler
5. Right-click the double in the listing view
6. Select Data -> Settings
7. Click 'normal' in the Mutability settings
8. Click constant
9. Click OK
10. Observe the decompiler again. The operands should be flipped, while the operator stays the same.

**Expected behavior**
I expected the constant to be placed last in the comparison, flipping the operands and operators as necessary to make the statement still be correct.

**Additional context**
I've also seen the bug on Windows 10 with versions 10.3.2, 10.4, 11.0, and 11.0.2
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Decompiler erroneously swapping operators without changing the operand in floating-point comparisons where data is marked constant (x86)"". This clearly describes a problem or flaw in how the decompiler handles certain operations when variables are marked as constants. Titles like this usually indicate issues that need fixing, which falls under bugs.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user describes a specific bug where comparing a float with a double variable using FCOM instructions causes the comparator to flip directions if the double is made constant. They provide an example showing incorrect code generation after marking a value as constant. This is a clear description of unexpected behavior, which aligns with a bug report.

The steps to reproduce are detailed and specific, which is typical for reporting bugs. The user also mentions their expected behavior, where the comparison should adjust both operands and operators correctly. Screenshots and an attachment further support this as a genuine issue rather than a feature request or other types of issues.

Looking at the patches provided: They show code changes in the SubfloatFlow class, specifically modifying how inputs are set for an operation. This indicates that a logical error was present and needed correction, which is consistent with bug fixes. The use of terms like ""preexistingGuard"" and adjusting input slots suggests they're fixing incorrect behavior related to operand ordering.

The environment details include OS, Java version, Ghidra versions, etc., which are standard for bug reports to help reproduce and identify the issue across different setups. The additional context mentions the bug occurring across multiple versions on different operating systems, reinforcing that this is an ongoing problem needing a fix.

Considering all these factors—the title describes an erroneous behavior, the body outlines the issue with examples and steps, patches correct specific code logic—it's clear that ""bug"" is the appropriate label. There’s no indication that this is a feature request, enhancement, or other category. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the report.

It attempts to install dependencies via npm but fails due to a `ReferenceError` indicating that `require` is not defined. The error occurs in `exec-child.js`. Dependency installation fails, but the project directory is still created.```

- Refs <URL>

But it's likely this one requires changes on Docusaurus level to support `--package-manager=deno`.

It can be bypassed with `--skip-install`, and then the command works.

```The code snippet navigates to the `my-website` directory and installs a Deno application with future permissions, allowing scripts to be executed.```

Then:

`````The log indicates that Deno is trying to start an app but port 3000 is already in use by another process. It suggests that the current process is likely running a Docusaurus app with a specific version. The user is prompted to choose whether they want to run the app on a different port instead.```

This is a compatibility issue, because I never ran `deno task start` before. Even tried to reboot my machine and the issue persists.

But then, accepting a different port:

```The log indicates that the Docusaurus website built successfully and is running at a specified URL. However, there were warnings about invalid images and errors related to the `md4` digest method during the build process.```

Looks like one of these were already reported:

- Refs <URL>

But `Digest method not supported: md4` is new, I believe.",0,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""installation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Docusaurus compatibility"". This suggests that the issue is about Deno being compatible with Docusaurus, which is a static site generator typically used with npm and Node.js.

Now, examining the body of the issue. The user tried to create a new Docusaurus project using Deno but ran into several errors. The first error was during dependency installation, where it complained about 'require' not being defined. This indicates an issue when trying to run npm packages within Deno, possibly related to how dependencies are handled or installed.

The user provided some workarounds, like skipping the install step and using a different command to install dependencies with Deno. However, they encountered more issues when trying to start the server, including warnings about images not loading correctly and a specific error about the digest method 'md4' not being supported. They also referenced other GitHub issues related to similar problems.

The body suggests that the problem isn't just about installing packages but also about runtime compatibility and how Deno handles certain Node.js modules or dependencies that Docusaurus relies on.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies parts of the code, introducing a new `DenoDirProvider` and integrating it into various functions. This seems to adjust how node_modules are resolved, possibly to avoid conflicts with Deno's own directories.

Patches 2 adjusts the `CliFactoryServices` by removing the `deno_dir_provider` from being a separate deferred service and instead retrieving it from `cli_options`. This change likely centralizes where the provider is managed within the application.

Patches 3 through 9 are adding new files or modifying existing ones, but they seem to be test cases or setup for reproducing the issue rather than fixing core functionality. For example, Patch 3 requires 'buffer' and logs a message, which might relate to Buffer handling in Node.js modules within Deno.

Putting it all together, the patches are addressing how dependencies are fetched, node_modules are resolved, and possibly how certain Node.js-specific functionalities (like 'require') are handled within Deno. The issue is broader than just installation; it's about ensuring that Docusaurus can run correctly in a Deno environment, which involves compatibility with npm packages, module resolution, and runtime behaviors.

Therefore, while the label ""installation"" captures part of the problem, such as the initial dependency installation failure, it doesn't fully encapsulate the deeper compatibility issues. The issue is more about ensuring that Docusaurus works seamlessly with Deno beyond just installing dependencies.
</think>

The label ""installation"" doesn't fully capture the essence of the issue, which pertains to broader compatibility with Docusaurus rather than just installation problems.

Okay, so I'm looking at this Rust issue where the problem is about an ""unconstrained generic constant."" The user provided some code examples that resulted in errors, and there were patches added to fix these issues.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. The error messages mention things like ""function takes 1 generic argument but 2 were supplied"" and ""unconstrained generic constant."" It seems like the compiler is having trouble with how generics are being used in const expressions or constants.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 2 adds another error message line, which suggests that the problem occurs more than once. Patch 3 modifies an error count from 5 to 6 errors, indicating that perhaps a new instance of the same issue is found, increasing the total number of errors reported.

Now, considering the labels assigned: ""unsoundness."" In Rust, unsoundness refers to situations where the type system is bypassed, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes. This can happen if there's a bug in the compiler that allows code which should be caught but isn't, violating Rust's memory safety guarantees.

The issue here seems to involve incorrect handling of generic constants, possibly leading to situations where the compiler doesn't properly constrain them, allowing invalid usages that could result in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This would indeed qualify as unsoundness because it breaks the type system's promises.

So, does the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflect this problem? Yes, because if the compiler isn't correctly constraining generic constants, it might allow code that should be rejected, potentially leading to memory safety issues or undefined behavior. Therefore, assigning the unsoundness label is appropriate.

I occasionally see this, and I think I've seen mention of this on the dev list; it might always be the same file; this morning I happened to catch it just after it happened. I also built yesterday morning. It doesn't happen too often (the revert file I see is from January), I haven't looked at makefiles, I don't know what dependency is triggering.

If anyone knows something specific to check...

It also includes steps to convert and update the Russian translation file (`ru.po`) to create a new file (`ru.cp1251.po`).

The diff seems to be a lot of formatting. Here's an excerpt, as seen in vim.

It interesting that the wrap, as shown in vim above, is happening right around column 80. With all these formatting changes it's hard to see if there are any real changes.

Using `gvim -d` to look at the checked in file and the it looks like the only changes are around the linebreak and that the translation itself has no changes.

Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""encoding"" accurately reflects the provided issue report and its associated patches. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: it's about character encoding issues in various languages. The problem seems to be with how text is displayed, possibly due to incorrect encoding settings.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. It describes specific errors when running certain commands in Vim, like incorrect characters for non-ASCII text and garbled output. This definitely points towards an encoding problem because incorrect encodings often cause such display issues.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 changes the encoding from 'cp1250' to 'CP1250'. The capitalization might matter in some systems, so this is related to encoding settings.

Patch 2 does something similar for 'big5', changing it to 'BIG5'. Again, this is about character encoding.

The other patches (3, 4, 5) adjust various lines across different files. For example, in patch 3, they fix the charset in a comment line from lowercase to uppercase. In patch 4 and 5, similar changes are made for Slovak and Taiwanese language files, adjusting the Content-Type header's charset parameter.

All these patches are tweaking how encoding is specified in the files, which directly relates to character encoding issues.

So, putting it all together: the issue revolves around incorrect or inconsistent encoding settings causing display problems. The patches correct these by standardizing the encoding identifiers, ensuring they're properly recognized.

Therefore, the label ""encoding"" accurately reflects this problem because the core of the issue and its solution are about how text is encoded and displayed.
</think>

The label ""encoding"" is appropriate because the issue and patches address character encoding problems affecting text display in Vim. The changes correct encoding specifications to resolve display issues.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""SimpleBlocksIT.testAddBlockWhileDeletingIndices failing"". This clearly indicates that a test case is failing. Test failures often point to bugs in the code because if a test passes before and starts failing, it suggests something changed that introduced an issue.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. There's a CI link which shows where the failure occurred. The repro line gives specific commands to reproduce the problem, which helps in diagnosing it. It mentions whether the issue reproduces reliably, which is ""Didn't try"", so maybe the reporter didn't test it manually but the CI did catch it. 

The ""Failure history"" is empty, meaning this might be a new issue or at least not one that's been recurring for a while. The failure excerpt shows an AssertionError with the message ""executed already"". That suggests some action was attempted to be performed more than once when it shouldn't have been. The stack trace points to specific parts of the code where listeners are handling failures, which might indicate race conditions or incorrect state management.

Looking at the patches provided, they seem to adjust how certain listeners and actions are handled in the code. For instance, replacing some anonymous listener implementations with lambda expressions using ActionListener.run(). This kind of change is typical when dealing with concurrency issues or ensuring that operations happen in the correct order. The error message about ""executed already"" implies that an action was attempted twice, so restructuring how these listeners are set up could prevent that.

The patches also involve wrapping some operations within run() methods and adjusting how exceptions are handled. This is often done to ensure proper synchronization or to avoid reentrant code paths that might cause the same action to execute multiple times unintentionally.

Given all this, the issue seems to be a bug because it's causing a test failure due to an unexpected exception. The patches address the root cause by restructuring how asynchronous operations are handled, likely fixing a race condition or incorrect state management leading to the ""executed already"" error.

So yes, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue as it involves unexpected behavior that was addressed with code changes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate because the issue describes a test failure due to an AssertionError caused by an unexpected exception. The patches address potential concurrency issues leading to the error, indicating a bug in the code.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""[Zone.js] `it.failing` and `test.failing` seem to be not patched for `Jest`"". That suggests there's an issue with Zone.js not handling certain Jest methods correctly, specifically the failing modifiers for it and test. 

Looking at the body, the user reports a TypeError: ""it.failing is not a function."" This error occurred when running tests, which indicates that during execution, the method it.failing wasn't recognized as a function. The problem was traced back to Zone.js not supporting these modifiers, and the issue was reproduced in a minimal setup.

The patches provided show that they added context[methodName].failing = (originalJestFn as any).failing; which means they were attaching the failing method to both it and test. So before this patch, when someone used it.failing or test.failing, Zone.js didn't properly handle these, leading to the runtime error.

The label assigned is ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically occurs during the execution of the program, not at compile time. In this case, the TypeError happens when Jest runs the tests, which fits the definition of a runtime error because it's an exception thrown during execution.

So putting it all together: The issue was causing a runtime error because Zone.js wasn't properly patching the failing methods for Jest, leading to a TypeError when those methods were called. The patches fixed this by ensuring the failing methods are correctly assigned, thus resolving the runtime error.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves an exception occurring during test execution due to unpatched methods in Zone.js.

Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Deno has panicked"" error. The word ""panicked"" directly indicates a panic occurred in Deno, which aligns with the label ""panic"".

Next, examining the body of the issue. The user encountered an error while trying to debug TypeScript with VSCode on a Raspberry Pi 4. The debug console shows several messages, including ""Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno."" Additionally, there's a stack trace mentioning a panic in the 'main' thread due to an error when trying to unwrap a Result, which caused the process to exit with code 1. All these details point towards a panic issue.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Each patch seems to address error handling around the inspector server setup. For example:

- Patch 1 changes `resolve_inspector_server` to return a Result, allowing proper error handling instead of panicking.
- Patches 2 and 4 modify functions to handle errors gracefully by returning them instead of unwrapping, which would cause panics.
- Patch 6 modifies the creation of InspectorServer to use proper error handling with `Result`, preventing panics when binding the TCP listener.

These patches indicate that the original issue was indeed a panic caused by improper error handling. By adjusting the code to handle errors without unwrapping or assuming success, the patches prevent the panic from occurring.

Considering all these points—the title, body details, and the nature of the fixes—it's clear that the label ""panic"" is appropriate because it directly addresses the root cause described in the issue.

Moving on to the body. The user provided several build scans and a reproduction line, which is helpful for debugging. They also mention that this doesn't reproduce locally, so it's probably an issue specific to the CI setup or environment.

The failure message shows an AssertionError due to data mismatches in rows and columns. For example, expected ""Success"" but got ""Disconnected"", and some IP addresses and numbers don't match. This indicates that during testing, the test expected certain values, but the actual results were different. It's a test assertion error, so the test is failing because of incorrect data outputs.

Now looking at the patches applied to fix this issue. Patch 1 seems to remove specific test cases related to EsqlSpecIT. Maybe those tests were causing flakiness and needed to be adjusted or removed. Patch 2 adds ""ignoreOrder:true"" in the test, which probably makes the test ignore the order of results. This could mean that without considering the order, the data mismatch might not occur because the test was previously failing due to unexpected ordering.

So, why is the label ""runtime error""? A runtime error typically refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, like exceptions or crashes. However, in this case, it's an assertion failure in a test. The tests are failing because of data mismatches, not because there was a crash or exception from the code itself.

The issue is more about the test expecting certain values but getting others, which suggests a problem with either the test setup, environment, or maybe the way the data is being handled. It's a test failure due to incorrect results rather than an actual runtime error in the application.

So, I think the label ""runtime error"" might not be accurate here because it's specifically about a failing test case rather than an error occurring during the execution of the code outside of testing. The correct labels should probably relate to test failures or data mismatches.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" doesn't accurately reflect this issue, which is about a test failure due to data mismatches rather than an actual runtime exception.

</p>
</details>
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""type system"" is accurate for this issue report. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The issue seems to be about errors related to associated types in Rust. From the patches, it looks like there were changes made to how error messages are displayed when associated types aren't specified properly. For example, in some test cases, the error message now includes more specific information about where the associated type is missing, including generics.

I remember that in Rust, associated types are a part of trait definitions and can be thought of as a way for traits to have their own types. So when you use a trait with dynamic dispatch (like using `dyn Trait`), you sometimes need to specify these associated types because the compiler might not be able to infer them automatically.

Looking at Patch 3, there's an error message change from ""Output in Div"" to ""Output in Div<Rhs>"". This indicates that the error now includes the generic parameter, making it clearer where exactly the problem is. Similarly, other patches adjust the error messages to include more specific type information.

The issue seems to be about improving how the compiler reports errors related to missing associated types, especially when dealing with traits and generics. So, this definitely falls under the category of the type system because it's about how Rust handles and reports issues with types during compilation.

The label ""type system"" would encompass errors related to type checking, trait systems, and associated types. Since all these changes are about enhancing error reporting for associated types in traits, which is a fundamental part of Rust's type system, the label seems appropriate.

I don't see any parts of this issue that would relate more to another label like ""syntax"" or ""compiler frontend."" It's specifically about how the compiler handles and reports type-related errors, so ""type system"" fits best.
</think>

The label ""type system"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue, which deals with associated types and error reporting within Rust's trait system.

Alright, let me try to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. The issue's title is ""Upgrade to Spring GraphQL 1.3.3"", which suggests they're updating a dependency version. 

Looking at the patches provided, there's a change in the library version from ""1.3.3-SNAPSHOT"" to ""1.3.3"". This indicates they're moving from a snapshot (which is usually a development version) to a stable release. That definitely sounds like a dependency upgrade because they're updating the version of an external library they're using.

The body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context, but the title and the patch clearly show a version change for Spring GraphQL. So the label ""dependency upgrade"" makes sense here.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[compiled autograd][cudagraphs] TLS is gc'd between unit test cudagraph runs."" It mentions that the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) for cudagraphs is being garbage collected between test runs. That immediately suggests an issue related to how resources are managed in memory during runtime, especially since it's happening across multiple tests.

Next, the body of the issue provides more context. The user describes a bug where running several local tests involving cudagraphs causes the TLS to be garbage collected. They even provided a reproduction command using pytest, pointing to specific test functions. This indicates that the problem occurs during the execution of these tests, which is definitely a runtime behavior.

Looking at the patches applied, there's an addition in the code where they import `torch._inductor.cudagraph_trees` inside a context manager. The comment mentions importing it lazily due to circular dependencies and ensuring that it's available when needed. This change seems aimed at preserving the TLS by making sure the necessary modules are properly imported and not garbage collected prematurely.

The assigned label is ""runtime,"" which typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the code, as opposed to build-time or compile-time errors. Since this problem manifests while running tests (a runtime activity) and the fix involves ensuring modules are correctly loaded at runtime to prevent premature garbage collection, it makes sense.

I don't see any indications that this is a bug related to the build process, compiler errors, or anything outside of execution time. Therefore, ""runtime"" seems appropriate here.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""content length"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is: ""TextInput maximum length limit does not work in old architecture for iOS."" That tells me that the problem is specifically with the maxLength property of a TextInput component in React Native, and it's not functioning correctly on iOS when using the old architecture. 

Looking at the body, the user provided steps to reproduce the issue. They created a new app with RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0, which means they're using the old architecture. They added a TextInput with maxLength set to 5, but it didn't work as expected. They also specified that this affects iOS and provided their React Native version as 0.76.1.

The environment info shows they're on macOS with Xcode 16.1, which is up-to-date, and the new architecture is disabled for iOS, which aligns with the problem description.

There's no stacktrace or logs, but the user mentions that it works in Snack, so maybe it's an environment-specific issue related to the old architecture.

Now looking at the patch provided. It changes a line in the Objective-C code where the condition checks if text.length is greater than _maxLength.integerValue. The patch modifies this to use allowedLength instead of directly accessing _maxLength. So, the fix involves how maxLength is handled in the TextInput component for iOS in the old architecture.

The label assigned was ""content length."" I need to determine if that's accurate. The issue is about the maxLength feature not working, which relates to limiting the content length of a text input. However, the problem isn't just about content length in general but specifically about how maxLength is implemented and enforced in the old architecture on iOS.

I'm thinking that while ""content length"" does touch on the aspect of maxLength, it's a bit broad. The issue is more specific to the functionality of maxLength not working, which could be labeled as a bug or a feature-specific problem rather than just content length. However, since maxLength directly relates to limiting content length, maybe ""content length"" is appropriate.

But wait, maybe there's a better label like ""maxlength"" or ""textinput"" that more precisely captures the issue. Alternatively, ""bug"" could be another option if it's about functionality not working as intended. But in this case, the label given is ""content length,"" which does relate to maxLength. So I think it's somewhat accurate because maxLength is about limiting the content's length.

Therefore, after considering all parts—the title, body, steps to reproduce, environment details, and the specific patch—it seems that the label ""content length"" does reflect the issue, even though it might not be the most specific term possible. It's still relevant enough to describe the problem at hand.

This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part tells me.

The title of the issue is ""[CI] MultiClusterSpecIT test {date.DocsDateFormat} failing"". The [CI] prefix suggests that this issue is related to Continuous Integration, which typically involves automated testing and builds. That's a hint that the label might be correct since CI issues usually pertain to failures in the build or test pipeline.

Looking at the body of the issue, it provides details about build scans with links to Gradle Enterprise, which is a tool used for CI/CD. The reproduction line shows a specific Gradle command that's failing when running tests, specifically pointing to a test method called ""test {date.DocsDateFormat}"". This indicates that the failure occurs during automated testing in the CI environment.

The issue also mentions ""Reproduces locally?: N/A"", which suggests it might not be easily reproducible outside of the CI setup. The failure history and the links provided point to dashboards tracking test failures, further indicating this is a problem within their CI system.

Now looking at the patches that resolved the issue: There are three patches. 

Patch 1 modifies a test configuration file, removing certain tests related to date formatting. This could mean that those specific tests were causing failures in the CI pipeline, so they were disabled or fixed.

Patches 2 and 3 add warning messages about JDK 23 changing how week-date field specifiers are handled. These patches seem to address issues in the code where date formats might be incompatible with upcoming Java versions. By adding these warnings, the tests can now pass because they account for the expected changes, or perhaps the failing assertions were due to these date format issues.

Putting it all together: The issue is about a test failure in the CI environment related to date formatting that's affected by JDK 23 changes. The patches address this by either modifying tests or adding warnings about deprecated formats. Since the problem originated from CI tests and was resolved through code changes, labeling it as ""ci"" makes sense because it pertains to the automated testing infrastructure.

Therefore, the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""ci"" is appropriate for this issue since it involves test failures within the Continuous Integration environment, specifically related to date formatting issues that were addressed through code patches.

Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

Starting with the title: ""Remove @babel/plugin-transform-classes"". This clearly mentions a Babel plugin, so that's relevant.

Looking at the body, the user discusses removing a specific Babel plugin because it's no longer necessary due to browser support for ES6 classes. They reference Lighthouse warnings about legacy transformations and suggest making this change in the next release or months. The issue affects performance and runtime areas across various stages like development and deployment. 

The patches provided show that they modified the Babel configuration, specifically around plugins. They added comments explaining that certain class-related plugins are conditionally enabled based on user options or browser support.

Considering all these points, the issue is about modifying how a specific Babel plugin is handled in Next.js's build process. The label ""plugin"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to changes made to Babel plugins within the project configuration.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""ci"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem says.

First, looking at the title: it's about disabling a test called test_invalid_port in TCPStoreTest. The body explains that the test was disabled because it's flaky and failing in CI. They provided links to logs and some stats on how often it fails and passes. There are instructions for debugging, which mentions looking into workflow logs where this test is flaky.

The patches show that the test method test_invalid_port was removed from the codebase. So, they stopped running this test because it was causing CI issues.

Now, what's a ""ci"" label usually used for? Typically, in GitHub issues, the ""ci"" label refers to problems related to continuous integration, such as failing tests, flaky tests, or build issues on the CI pipelines.

In this case, the issue is about a test being disabled because it was causing CI failures. The problem was identified through CI logs and workflow runs. The solution was to remove the problematic test to prevent CI from failing.

So, does the ""ci"" label fit here? Yes, because the entire issue revolves around the test causing instability in the CI system. The problem is directly related to continuous integration, as it's about a flaky test affecting the build processes.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Spring HATEOAS 2.2.1"". That immediately tells me that this is about updating a dependency. The specific mention of upgrading from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 in the patches also supports this.

Next, examining the patches provided, there's only one patch shown. It modifies a line in what looks like a build configuration file (maybe a Gradle or Maven pom file). The change is from version ""2.2.0"" to ""2.2.1"". This clearly indicates that the issue was resolved by updating the dependency version.

The body of the issue is empty, but the title and patches are sufficient to understand the action taken. There's no additional context or alternative solutions provided, so the focus is solely on the upgrade.

Considering common GitHub labels, ""dependency upgrade"" is a standard label used when an issue involves updating a project's dependencies. Since this issue's sole purpose was to update Spring HATEOAS from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, assigning the ""dependency upgrade"" label makes sense.

I don't see any other labels that would better fit here. There's no indication of a bug fix, feature request, or documentation change. It's straightforward—just an upgrade to a newer version of a library.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue's intent and the changes made. So, the answer should be 1.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly identifies that the issue was about updating a project dependency from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.1. The patches confirm this by showing the version change in the build configuration.

### What did you expect to see?

Functions like `NewMethodSet` and methods like `String` should continue to work in the presence of CGo.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let's break down what each part tells me.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it says ""go/types: 'under' panics on Alias type"". The word ""panics"" here immediately stands out because a panic in Go is an unrecovered error that crashes the program. So the issue is about a situation where the code is panicking when it shouldn't.

Next, I'll read through the body of the issue. The user provides their environment details and explains that after upgrading from Go 1.22.4 to 1.23.0, they encountered a problem with using certain APIs like `String` on `*types.Named` and functions like `NewMethodSet`. They included a stack trace showing a panic in the `under` method of the `Named` type. This indicates that when their code tried to use these Go types functionalities, it resulted in a runtime panic.

The user also mentions what they expected: for those functions and methods to continue working without issues, especially in the presence of cgo, which suggests they might be using some C bindings or CGo features in their project. The expectation is that upgrading shouldn't introduce such panics.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a test case `TestIssue68877` where it defines a type alias and checks if the `String()` method on the `TypeName` returns the correct string without panicking. This suggests that the panic was occurring when trying to get the string representation of an aliased type.

Patches 2 and 4 modify the `cleanup` function in the `Named` struct's method. They change a case statement from handling only `*Named` to include `*Alias`. The comment mentions that `t.under()` might add entries, implying that without this change, when an `Alias` type was processed, it might not call `t.under()`, leading to the panic.

Patch 3 is similar but sets an environment variable and tests under different conditions, ensuring the panic doesn't occur in those scenarios either.

Putting it all together: The issue is about a panic happening when using Go's type system with alias types after an upgrade. The patches fix this by adjusting how `Named` and `Alias` types are handled during cleanup or string conversion, preventing the panic.

So the label assigned was ""panic"". Since the problem was indeed a panic occurring due to specific type operations, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The issue report is about a panic occurring in Go's type system when handling alias types after an upgrade. The patches address this by modifying how these types are managed, preventing the panic.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""ci"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Remove use of `macos-12` image"". This immediately tells me that the problem is about replacing a specific macOS image version in some part of the project. The body of the issue links to a GitHub changelog post discussing upcoming deprecations and breaking changes in GitHub Actions runners, which suggests that this change is related to CI/CD infrastructure.

Next, examining the patches applied. Both Patch 1 and Patch 2 show changes where `macos-12` is being replaced with `macos-13`. Specifically, they modify the `runs-on` field in GitHub Actions workflow files. This indicates that the issue was about updating the runner images used in CI pipelines to a newer version.

The label assigned here is ""ci"". Since the issue deals directly with changing the runner images in GitHub Actions, which is part of continuous integration setup, the label seems appropriate. The changes are not about a bug fix or new feature but about the infrastructure that runs the tests and builds, hence falling under CI.

I don't see any aspects of this issue that would relate to other labels like ""bug"", ""enhancement"", or ""documentation"". It's purely about updating the CI configuration to use a newer macOS image version as per GitHub's deprecation notice.
</think>

The label ""ci"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to updating the CI runner images in GitHub Actions.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Cancel ADD INDEX job with DXF is slow."" The key terms here are ""ADD INDEX,"" which relates to indexing in databases. So the problem is about adding an index and then cancelling that job being slow.

Next, the body of the issue provides a bug report. It outlines steps to reproduce the problem, which involves enabling certain TiDB settings, setting a low write speed, adding an index, and then attempting to cancel the job. The user's expectation was that the cancellation would happen in a timely manner, but instead, it took a long time for the state to change from 'canceling' to 'rollback done.' This further indicates that the issue is related to how indexing operations are handled when they're canceled.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Each patch modifies functions related to reorgCtx and ddlCtx, which are components involved in the DDL (Data Definition Language) operations, particularly for adding indexes. For example, Patch 1 changes the function parameters from jobID to context, suggesting a refactor in how the reorganization context is handled during cancellations.

Patch 2 removes some testing functions related to ReorgCtx, which might be part of cleaning up or refactoring the code to improve how the state is managed when operations are canceled. Patch 3 and subsequent patches adjust function calls to pass context instead of job IDs, which likely affects how cancellations propagate through different parts of the system.

Patch 4 modifies error handling during cancellation by using a more specific error message that includes the job ID, improving clarity for debugging. Patch 5 removes test functions related to ReorgCtx, possibly because those tests are no longer necessary or were causing issues.

Patch 6 refactors the reorgCtx struct and methods, removing fields like jobState and methods like isReorgCanceled, isReorgPaused, etc., which suggests that the way the state is tracked during index operations has been changed. This could be to make state management more efficient or to prevent race conditions that might cause delays in cancellation.

Patch 7 adds a new test function, TestAddIndexDistCancelWithPartition, which specifically tests the cancellation of add index jobs with partitioning, ensuring that after the fix, cancellations happen as expected without delays. This indicates that the problem was significant enough to warrant additional testing to prevent regressions.

Putting this all together, the issue is fundamentally about a problem during the ADD INDEX operation—specifically, how quickly and effectively such operations can be canceled when needed. All the patches are aimed at improving the cancellation mechanism for index additions by adjusting context handling, error management, state tracking, and test coverage.

The label ""indexing"" captures the essence of this issue because it's about adding indexes and the associated behavior during their lifecycle, including cancellation. The problem isn't related to querying or other database operations but is specifically tied to DDL operations involving indexes.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39622,bug,Banner printing doesn't respect set charset,Forward port of issue #39621 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""Banner printing doesn't respect set charset."" That sounds like a problem where something isn't working as intended. The body says it's a forward port of another issue, which suggests it's an existing bug that needs to be fixed in a different branch or version.

Now looking at the patches made:

Patch 1 modifies some Java code related to banner printing. It adds an import for StandardCharsets and changes how the charset is handled when creating the string from the banner. Specifically, it sets a default to UTF-8 if the environment property isn't set. This indicates that previously, the charset wasn't being respected correctly, which would cause issues with how text is displayed, possibly leading to incorrect characters or encoding errors.

Patch 2 adds a test case where it checks that the banner uses UTF-8. It mocks the environment and tests whether the printer logs the correct UTF-8 characters (like emojis). This test ensures that after the fix, the charset is correctly applied, preventing any bugs related to incorrect encoding.

Patch 3 just adds a line with some UTF-8 characters, likely as a test banner file to verify the fix works correctly when the charset is set properly.

Putting it all together, the problem was that the banner wasn't using the correct charset, which would be a bug since it's not functioning as intended. The patches fix this by ensuring the correct charset is used and adding tests to confirm the behavior. Therefore, labeling this issue as a ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem being addressed.

pingcap/tidb,55156,constraint,"JDBC test related to schema, FK and `useInformationSchema=true` failed","## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Run the test of mysql j connector on TiDB, and the test `testBug95280` failed. It tests to get the FK information from JDBC. When the `useIS=false`, the test will pass, and when the `useIS=true`, the test failed (and get a redundant row).

When `useIS=true`, the mysql J connector will run the following SQL:

```This SQL query retrieves details about foreign key constraints from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. It selects and formats information such as table schemas, names, columns, constraint names, and update/delete rules from joined tables related to foreign key constraints. The results are filtered by specific table name and schema, ordered by referenced table schema and name and ordinal position.```

Therefore, this issue can be reproduced by the following SQLs:

```The SQL code creates two databases (`dbBug95280_1` and `dbBug95280_2`) with similar table structures. Each database contains two tables: `table1` for categories and `table2` for products, where `table2` has a foreign key referencing `table1`. The second part of the code retrieves the details of the foreign key constraints defined in `table2` of `dbBug95280_1`.```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The test pass

And the SQL return one row

```The log shows a foreign key constraint between `table1` and `table2` in schema `dbBug95280_1`. The primary key column in `table1` is `cat_id`, and the corresponding foreign key column in `table2` is also `cat_id`. The constraint is named `table2_ibfk_1`, and it is defined on the primary key `PRIMARY`. The constraint action is set to cascade updates and delete related records in `table2` when a referenced record in `table1` is deleted.```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The test failed

```The log shows two records of foreign key constraints:

1. Table `table1` in schema `dbBug95280_1` references `table2` in schema `dbBug95280_1` on column `cat_id`.
2. Table `table1` in schema `dbBug95280_2` references `table2` in schema `dbBug95280_2` on column `cat_id`.

Both constraints have the same properties:
- Update rule: No action (`0`)
- Delete rule: Cascade (`1`)
- Constraint name: `fk_cat`
- Primary key constraint name: `PRIMARY`
- Deferrability: Initially valid (`7`)```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```The log indicates that the TiDB version is v8.3.0-alpha-65-g94d8c123ef, with the Edition being Community. The Git Commit Hash is 94d8c123ef02f2f5543a99a937ce135ade0fe997, and it was built on August 2, 2024, at 04:26 UTC. The Go version used is go1.22.5, and race detection is disabled.```

",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""constraint"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down what I know.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""JDBC test related to schema, FK and `useInformationSchema=true` failed."" This tells me that the problem is related to a JDBC test involving schemas, foreign keys (FK), and the use of Information Schema when `useInformationSchema` is set to true.

In the body, the user explains that when running the test with `useIS=true`, an extra row is returned, causing the test to fail. They provided the SQL query that's being run, which seems to fetch foreign key information from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables. The issue arises because the query returns two rows instead of one when it should only return data for a specific schema.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies how schemas are filtered in the `memtableRetriever`. It adds checks to skip certain schemas based on the extractor's filters, which might help in ensuring that only relevant schemas are considered. This could prevent extra rows from being returned when querying across multiple schemas.

Patches 2 and 3 add test cases that create tables in different databases (db1 and db2) with foreign keys and then query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to check if the filtering works correctly. These tests ensure that when querying for a specific schema, only the relevant rows are returned without including others.

The label assigned is ""constraint."" Constraints in databases refer to rules applied to table data, such as primary keys, foreign keys, etc. The issue here revolves around foreign key constraints and how they're being fetched from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. The problem was that the query was returning extra rows from different schemas, which relates to how constraints are being handled across schemas.

Considering all this, the label ""constraint"" seems appropriate because the issue is directly tied to how foreign key constraints are being queried and returned in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. The patches address filtering and ensuring that only the relevant constraints (from the correct schema) are included, which aligns with the problem described.

elastic/elasticsearch,107983,configuration,What is the significance of the assertion for `line.size` in `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/../cpu.stat`?,"Why do we need to assert `line.size`? Can this line of code be safely removed? On some systems, the value of `line.size` is 6, and enabling the JVM `-ea` parameter during testing leads to startup failures.
<URL>

For example: 


```This code snippet uses the `cat` command to display the contents of the file `cpu.stat` located in the slice directory `user-59756`.```

```The log indicates that there have been no periods of throttling, no bursts, and no throttling time. It also notes a total wait time of 78,240,156,074 units.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""configuration"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""What is the significance of the assertion for `line.size` in `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/../cpu.stat`?"" The user is asking about why a specific line of code (an assertion on the size of lines) is needed. They're also questioning if it can be safely removed because on some systems, this causes startup failures when JVM assertions are enabled.

In the body, they provide an example where `cpu.stat` has more entries than expected, specifically mentioning ""wait_sum"" as an extra entry. So the issue seems to revolve around handling varying numbers of lines in a system file and how the code deals with that variance.

Now, looking at the patches made: The first patch adds an ignore for additional cpu.stat fields and is categorized under type: bug. The second patch modifies the assertion from checking if `lines.size()` is exactly 3 or 5 to instead check if it's greater than or equal to 3. They also added comments explaining that when a certain feature (schedstat_enabled) is on, an additional field called wait_sum appears.

So, the problem was that the code was assuming a fixed number of lines in `cpu.stat`, but in reality, this number can vary based on system configurations or enabled features. The fix involves making the code more flexible by allowing any number of lines as long as it's at least 3 and adding documentation about why extra fields are present.

Now, considering the label ""configuration."" Configuration issues usually relate to settings, setup, or parameters that affect how software behaves. In this case, the issue arises because different systems might have varying configurations leading to different numbers of entries in `cpu.stat`. The fix involves making the code handle these variations more gracefully by ignoring extra fields and adjusting the assertion.

However, I'm a bit on the fence here. While it's related to how the system is configured (since different setups produce different line counts), the issue itself is more about the code not handling variable data correctly. It's a bug because the code made an incorrect assumption about fixed data sizes, causing failures under certain conditions.

So, ""configuration"" might be a bit of a stretch here. The problem isn't about configuration settings in the software but rather about the code's inability to handle varying system configurations. Therefore, the label might not perfectly capture the essence of the issue, which is more about a bug or an issue with flexibility in handling different system states.

Wait, no, maybe ""configuration"" is appropriate because it's about how the code reads system configuration files and handles variations based on the system's setup. The patch was to ignore additional fields, which are part of the system's configuration output.

Hmm, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, it's a bug caused by incorrect assumptions, but on the other, it's about handling varying configurations from the system. So maybe ""configuration"" is still a fitting label because the issue stems from differences in system configurations leading to different file outputs.
</think>

The label ""configuration"" is appropriate because the issue arises from variations in system configuration files that the code needed to handle more flexibly. The patches addressed this by making the code robust against such variations.

microsoft/vscode,235821,bug,Toggle Reaction doesn't always show on first load of comments,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Toggle Reaction doesn't always show on first load of comments."" That suggests there's an issue where a feature isn't working as expected when the page loads. The toggle reaction not appearing consistently points to something not functioning correctly, which is a common sign of a bug.

The body of the issue is empty, so I don't have any additional context from there. But usually, titles are pretty descriptive in GitHub issues, so the title alone gives me a good clue.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There's some code that was changed to fix this issue. Let me try to understand what the patch does.

In Patch 1, they modified a section of the CommentNode class. They removed an if statement that checked if hasReactionHandler is true and created toggleReactionAction inside it. Instead, they now assign toggleReactionAction using a ternary operator based on hasReactionHandler. Then, they check if toggleReactionAction exists before pushing it into actions.

Also, in another part of the patch, they added code to unshift the toggleReactionAction into the primary actions array if it exists.

So what does this mean? It looks like they're ensuring that the toggle reaction action is properly initialized and added to the toolbar under the correct conditions. Maybe before, the action wasn't being added when it should have been on the first load because of how the condition was structured.

The original code had an if statement that only created the toggleReactionAction if hasReactionHandler was true. Then, inside that block, they pushed it into actions. But perhaps this caused the action to not be available in certain cases during the initial load, hence the bug where it doesn't show up.

By moving the creation of toggleReactionAction outside and conditionally setting it, then checking again if it exists before adding it, they ensure that the action is more reliably added when it should be. This would make the reaction picker appear consistently on first load, fixing the bug described in the issue.

So putting this all together: The title indicates a problem with functionality not working as expected (a bug), and the patches adjust the code to fix that behavior by ensuring actions are correctly added. Therefore, labeling it as a ""bug"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""You are a..."". Hmm, that doesn't seem relevant. Wait, maybe it's part of a longer conversation or context. But in this case, I think it's an incomplete prompt from an AI interaction.

Now, the issue report content is actually a diff between two code files, specifically test files related to Next.js security headers and nonce validation. The tests are checking if nonces with escape characters cause errors and if the correct headers are set when using CSP.

The patches made include modifying test cases for nonce handling, adding error messages, and adjusting expected status codes based on runtime environments. These changes suggest that there was a problem in how nonces were being validated or handled, which led to incorrect behavior—like not throwing an error when it should have.

Since these are tests and bug fixes related to security headers and nonce validation, they imply that prior to the fix, the system didn't handle certain cases correctly. For example, allowing invalid nonces without proper escaping could be a security vulnerability or a functional bug if the application crashed instead of handling it gracefully.

The label ""bug"" is assigned because these patches address issues in how the code handles specific edge cases and errors. The tests ensure that the system behaves as expected when encountering malformed nonces, which directly relates to fixing bugs in the original implementation.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42198,forward port,Bump jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1,Forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Alright, let's see what I've got here. So, there's a GitHub issue report with a specific title and body, along with some patches that were applied to fix it. The question is whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this issue based on those details.

First, looking at the title: ""Bump jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1."" That sounds like a version upgrade for a dependency or tool. So someone is updating the JFrog CLI setup action in their GitHub workflow from an older version (4.3.2) to a newer one (4.4.1).

Now, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x."" Hmm, okay. So this current issue is taking something that was done in another issue (#42197) and applying it to a different branch or version line, specifically 3.3.x. That makes me think they're backporting a change from one version (maybe main or a newer release branch) into the 3.3.x maintenance branch.

Looking at the patches provided, all three of them are changing the same thing: updating the JFrog CLI setup action's version from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1 in different places within the workflow files. So, each patch is just an update in a specific part of the repository where this setup step is used.

Now, the label assigned here is ""forward port."" I'm trying to recall what that means. In software development, ""forward porting"" typically refers to taking a change from an older version and applying it to a newer version. Wait, no, actually, maybe I got that backwards. Or perhaps ""backport"" is moving a fix from a newer branch to an older one, while ""forward port"" might be moving something from an older to a newer. But sometimes the terms can be a bit confusing.

Wait, in this case, the issue says it's a forward port of #42197 to 3.3.x. So if #42197 was perhaps applied to main or another branch, and now they're applying the same change to the 3.3.x branch, that would indeed be a forward port. Alternatively, maybe ""forward port"" here is intended to mean moving changes from one version line to another.

But looking at the patches themselves, all they do is update the JFrog CLI version in different parts of the workflow files. So it's a straightforward dependency upgrade. The body mentions that this is a forward port of issue #42197 to 3.3.x, implying that #42197 was perhaps the original bump from 4.3.2 to 4.4.1 in another branch, and now they're applying the same change to the 3.3.x branch.

So does the label ""forward port"" make sense here? Well, if the issue is about taking a change made elsewhere (in #42197) and applying it to the 3.3.x branch, then yes, that's a forward porting effort. So the label seems appropriate because they're moving or forwarding the fix or update from one place to another.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes ""forward port"" might not be the exact term used for this process. It could also be called a backport if it's moving changes to an older version branch, depending on how the branches are structured. But in this case, since 3.3.x is a specific release line and they're applying the same version bump, I think ""forward port"" fits because they're carrying forward the change into another context.

Therefore, considering all that, the label ""forward port"" does accurately reflect what's happening here. The issue is about taking an existing change (from #42197) and ensuring it applies to the 3.3.x branch by updating the same dependency version in various parts of the codebase.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this issue report as it involves applying a change from another issue (#42197) to a different branch (3.3.x). The patches update the JFrog CLI version across multiple workflow files, consistent with forward porting changes.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Spring Integration 6.3.0-RC1"". That clearly indicates that the purpose is to update a dependency to a new version, specifically from a snapshot to an RC (Release Candidate) version.

Next, the body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context there. But the title is quite descriptive on its own, pointing directly to a version upgrade of Spring Integration.

Now, examining the patches made. The patch provided shows that in the build configuration file, specifically the bom section, the library dependency for ""Spring Integration"" was updated from 6.3.0-SNAPSHOT to 6.3.0-RC1. This is a clear indication that the project is upgrading its dependency version.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Considering all the information—the title explicitly mentions an upgrade, and the patch confirms the version change in dependencies—it seems perfectly appropriate. There's no mention of any other type of issue like a bug fix or feature request; it's solely about updating a library version.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41836,dependency upgrade,Bump gradle/actions from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0,Forward port of issue #41835 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by looking at the title of the issue: ""Bump gradle/actions from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0."" The word ""bump"" here suggests an increase or update in version, which usually refers to upgrading a dependency.

Next, I'll check the body of the issue. It says, ""Forward port of issue #41835 to 3.4.x."" This indicates that this issue is taking something from another issue (probably a fix or change) and applying it to a different branch or version line. So, the context here is about updating or adjusting existing code to work with a newer version.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are four patches, each modifying different files in the repository. Let's go through them one by one.

Patch 1 changes the setup-gradle action from version d9c87d481d55 (which is v3.5.0) to af1da67850ed (v4.0.0). This clearly shows that a dependency on Gradle actions is being upgraded from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0.

Patch 2 does something similar in two places: updating the wrapper-validation and setup-gradle actions to use the same newer version of Gradle actions (v4.0.0). This reinforces that multiple dependencies are being updated.

Patch 3 removes a job related to validating the Gradle wrapper, specifically referencing the older version (d9c87d481d55). It seems like this patch is cleaning up or removing an outdated setup now that it's being upgraded.

Patch 4 again updates the setup-gradle action in another context, switching from v3.5.0 to v4.0.0. This further confirms that the dependency on Gradle actions is being bumped up across different parts of the repository.

Putting this all together: The issue title and body mention bumping a version and porting changes, which are consistent with upgrading dependencies. Each patch modifies references to Gradle actions, replacing the older version with a newer one. Therefore, the label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate because it accurately describes the action taken—upgrading the gradle/actions dependency from 3.5.0 to 4.0.0 across multiple places in the repository.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate as all patches consistently update the Gradle actions version, reflecting a clear dependency upgrade.

My first thought here is that it should just be changed to try both with and without `exeFileExt()`. That way, I can pass `.{""npm"", ""npm.cmd""}` and it should just work on Windows/Unix. I can open a PR for that if it's considered an acceptable solution.",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The title of the issue says that `std.Build.findProgram()` can't find non-`.exe` programs on Windows. So it's pointing out a limitation in how the function works, specifically when dealing with programs that don't have an `.exe` extension.

Looking at the body, the user explains that the function appends the executable file extension (like `.exe`) to each name when searching for programs. This makes sense why non-`.exe` files like `npm.cmd` aren't found on Windows. The user suggests modifying the function to try both with and without the extension, which would make it work across different operating systems.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies the `findProgram` function by introducing a new helper function `tryFindProgram`. This function seems to handle checking for multiple extensions, including those supported by Windows. It also considers environment variables like `PATHEXT`, which lists all valid executable extensions on Windows. By iterating through these, it can find programs with any of the supported extensions.

Patch 2 updates an enum from `CreateProcessSupportedExtension` to `WindowsExtension`. This change renames the enum but doesn't seem to add new functionality. However, it keeps the code in sync and makes the names more descriptive.

So, what's the nature of this issue? It's about improving how the function handles executable files on Windows by supporting multiple extensions beyond just `.exe`. The problem was a limitation, and the solution expands the capability of `findProgram` to handle a broader range of cases. This feels like an enhancement because it's adding new functionality or improving existing behavior rather than fixing a bug.

Wait, but some might argue that not finding non-`.exe` files is a bug since it doesn't work as expected on Windows where multiple extensions are valid. However, the patches don't just fix a broken feature; they extend the function to support more use cases, which aligns with an enhancement.

Also, in open-source projects, labels help categorize issues. ""Enhancement"" typically refers to new features or improvements, while ""bug"" is for fixes. Since this issue was about expanding functionality to handle more scenarios, ""enhancement"" seems appropriate.

The label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves improving the function's capability rather than fixing a bug.

First, looking at the title: ""An invalid netrc file does not produce a warning."" This suggests that there's an unexpected behavior when the netrc file is invalid. The system isn't giving any warning about it, which could be confusing for users because they might not realize their configuration is wrong.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user migrated from Poetry to Uv and encountered a problem due to a syntax error in their netrc file. They mention that Uv silently ignores the error, making it hard to diagnose the issue. They suggest that instead of ignoring it, Uv should log a warning when there's a parsing error with the netrc file.

So, from this, it seems like the problem is that the current behavior doesn't inform the user about an invalid netrc file. Instead of silently failing, the system should provide feedback. This sounds like a bug because the expected behavior (logging a warning) isn't happening, leading to potential confusion and difficulty in troubleshooting.

Now looking at the patches made to resolve this issue. The code changes include modifications to handle errors when loading the netrc file. They introduced an enum NetrcMode with different states: Automatic, Enabled, Disabled. In the default implementation for NetrcMode, they're using LazyLock to load the netrc file. If there's an IO error (specifically if the file isn't found), it logs a debug message. For other errors, like parsing issues, it logs a warning using `warn!`.

In the middleware code, when constructing AuthMiddleware, instead of directly using Netrc::new(), they're now using this NetrcMode which encapsulates the error handling. The with_netrc method is updated to set the mode appropriately based on whether a netrc is provided.

The key part here is that the patch adds logging for errors when parsing the netrc file. So, when an invalid netrc is loaded, it logs a warning instead of staying silent. This directly addresses the issue reported by adding the necessary feedback.

Putting this together: The issue was about unexpected behavior (no warning on invalid netrc) which qualifies as a bug because it's a deviation from expected functionality. The patches fix this by adding error logging, which means the label ""bug"" is appropriate here.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue since it describes an unintended behavior where an invalid configuration isn't reported, and the patches address this by adding proper warnings.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39138,enhancement,Retry JDK downloads,"A couple of builds failed recently as the JDK download tasks failed due to the connection being reset. To make the build a little more robust, we should automatically retry the downloads.",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Retry JDK downloads"". This suggests that the problem is about handling failed JDK downloads by retrying them. So, it seems like a feature addition or improvement rather than fixing a bug.

The body of the issue explains that builds failed because the connection was reset during JDK downloads. The user proposes making the build more robust by automatically retrying the downloads. This sounds like adding a new functionality to handle retries, which would make the system more reliable.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Both Patch 1 and Patch 2 add a line `retries 3` in the task configuration. This means they're implementing a retry mechanism with three attempts. Adding this parameter is enhancing the existing download task by making it retry failed downloads, which directly addresses the issue described.

So, the label ""enhancement"" fits because it's improving the system's behavior rather than fixing a bug. If it were a bug fix, the label might be something like ""bug"" or ""fix"". Since this is adding a new feature to make the download process more robust, ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the changes made.
</think>

The issue report and patches add retry functionality to improve reliability, which is an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33091,regression,Trace and Span IDs are no longer propagated RequestBodyAdvice beans,"Originally raised in <URL> (with a reproducer project).

It looks to me like the reason for lack of Trance and Span IDs is the fix for #32730.

If you run the sample with Spring Boot 3.3.0 with a breakpoint in `OncePerRequestFilter.doFilter()` you'll see that the call to`skipDispatch()` return `false`. With Spring Boot 3.3.1 `skipDispatch()` returns `true` because [the `shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch()` method has been removed](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what a regression is in software terms. A regression usually refers to a bug that was introduced in a newer version of the software which wasn't present in previous versions. So, if something used to work and then stopped working after an update, that's a regression.

Looking at the title of the issue: ""Trace and Span IDs are no longer propagated RequestBodyAdvice beans."" This suggests that trace and span IDs were being propagated before but aren't anymore. That sounds like functionality that has regressed.

Now, the body of the issue provides more context. It mentions that the problem was originally raised in another Spring Boot issue (#41220) with a reproducer project. The user believes the cause is related to a fix for issue #32730. They explain that after updating from Spring Boot 3.3.0 to 3.3.1, the method `skipDispatch()` returns true because another method was removed in a commit. This led to the trace and span IDs not being propagated as before.

The patches provided show changes made to fix this issue. In Patch 1, they added an override for `shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch()` to return false instead of whatever it did before. They also adjusted conditions where the observation is stopped based on dispatcher type. In Patch 2, there are test cases added or modified, such as changing a test from expecting not to process async dispatches to now allowing them and adding new tests to check if observations are correctly handled in async contexts.

Putting this together: The original problem was introduced when a previous fix (for #32730) caused the trace IDs to stop propagating. This indicates that after an update, functionality broke which wasn't broken before—so it fits the definition of a regression. The patches aim to correct this by reverting or adjusting how async dispatches are handled.

Therefore, assigning the label ""regression"" seems accurate because the issue is due to a change in behavior introduced in a newer version that breaks existing functionality.

microsoft/vscode,213630,documentation,ChatResultFeedbackKind Unhelpful and Helpful doc comments are mixed up,"Testing #213514

Unhelpful mentions helpful in doc comment and vice versa.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""ChatResultFeedbackKind Unhelpful and Helpful doc comments are mixed up."" The word ""doc comments"" immediately stands out, which refers to documentation comments in code. So the issue is about a problem with the documentation.

The body of the issue says, ""Testing #213514. Unhelpful mentions helpful in doc comment and vice versa."" This confirms that the documentation comments for these enums have their descriptions swapped. That's definitely a documentation issue because it's about the accuracy of the comments explaining the code.

Now looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 shows changes to an enum called ChatResultFeedbackKind. The comments for Unhelpful and Helpful were swapped, which is exactly what the body described. So the fix was correcting the doc comments.

There's another patch that adds some lines about cancelling a stream, but that seems unrelated to the main issue. The primary change is in the documentation of the enum values.

Since both the title, body, and the relevant patches all pertain to incorrect or swapped documentation comments, the label ""documentation"" fits perfectly. It accurately describes the nature of the problem and the fix applied.
</think>

The label ""documentation"" is appropriate because the issue concerns incorrect doc comments which were fixed by swapping them.

vim/vim,15275,missing,Missing separator,<URL>,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""missing"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by looking at the issue's title and body.

The title is ""Missing separator,"" which suggests that there was an issue where a separator was missing somewhere in the code. The body of the issue is a link to a specific line in the Vim repository's Makefile, pointing to line 320 of src/po/Makefile. That indicates that the problem is related to that particular line.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

In Patch 1, there are two changes:
- Line 314: Changed from `POT_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH != pwd` to `POT_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH = $(PWD)`
- Line 327: Changed from `MO_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH != pwd` to `MO_PLUGPACKAGE_PATH = $(PWD)`

It seems like the issue was with how the POT and MO paths were being set. The original code used `!= pwd`, which is a shell command substitution, but perhaps that wasn't working correctly in this context because it's inside a Makefile. Changing it to `$(PWD)` might be more appropriate for Make syntax, as variables are typically accessed with $(VAR). This would fix the missing separator issue if the paths weren't being set properly before.

Patch 2 adds an included patch number 595. It looks like this is adding a new patch to a list of patches in some code file. The inclusion of patch 595 could be related to the missing separator, perhaps indicating that this specific patch addresses that particular problem.

Putting it together: The issue was about a missing separator in line 320 of Makefile. The patches changed how variables are assigned by replacing shell commands with Make variables and added a new patch entry. This suggests that the original problem was indeed due to a missing or incorrect path separator, which caused issues in the build process. Therefore, applying these patches fixed the issue.

The label ""missing"" was assigned. Since the problem involved something being missing (the correct path separator or variable assignment), this label does seem appropriate because it captures the essence of the issue—something was missing or incorrect, leading to a problem that needed fixing.

In addition, we should allow to open in the background from the picker, so that multiple entries can be looked at.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The issue's title is about improving the local history feature in an editor. It mentions two main points: sorting the picker by recent editor history and allowing background opening. The body elaborates that currently, the list is huge and not sorted by relevance, making it less useful. The user suggests prioritizing recent editors and enabling background access for efficiency.

Looking at the patches provided, they show changes in code related to how resources are fetched and displayed. They import additional services like IHistoryService and modify the resource picker to sort based on recency. There's also a change allowing the entry picker to accept input in the background by setting canAcceptInBackground to true.

The label assigned is ""workspace."" In GitHub, labels help categorize issues. The term ""workspace"" generally refers to features related to the editor environment, including local history, file management, and user interface elements like pickers. Since this issue deals with enhancing how local history entries are displayed and interacted with within the editor, it fits under workspace-related improvements.

I don't see any mentions of areas outside the workspace, such as API changes, bugs in specific extensions, or performance issues unrelated to UI/UX. All modifications are within the editor's functionality, specifically improving user interaction with local history.

Therefore, the label ""workspace"" accurately captures the essence of this issue report.
</think>

The label ""workspace"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to enhancing the local history feature within the editor environment, which falls under workspace improvements.

master, v8.4.0",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""infoschema"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""unexpected 'infoschema v1/v2 switch' log"". The word ""infoschema"" is right there in the title, which immediately suggests that the problem is related to infoschema. So the label seems relevant just from the title alone.

Next, reading through the body of the issue, it's a bug report about unexpected logging when switching between v1 and v2 of infoschema. The user describes starting a new TiDB instance on master version 8.4.0 and expecting to see logs using infoschema v2 but instead finding messages about a switch between versions. This further indicates that the issue is specifically about infoschema and its versioning.

Now, looking at the patches provided. The changes are in functions related to loading info schemas and deciding whether to use v1 or v2. There's a function called shouldUseV2 which has parameters related to old info schema and snapshot loads. The patch modifies how this function behaves when the old info schema is nil or not, affecting whether it returns enableV2 and sets isV1V2Switch correctly.

These patches directly address the handling of infoschema versions within the codebase, aiming to prevent unexpected switching between v1 and v2 which was causing the log messages mentioned in the issue. So the changes are clearly targeted at the infoschema component.

Considering all these points—the title mentions ""infoschema"", the body describes issues with version switching logs, and the patches modify functions handling info schema versions—it's clear that the label ""infoschema"" is accurate and directly related to the problem being reported and resolved.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""DISABLED test_cow_input_sparse_sampled_addmm_cuda_float32 (__main__.TestCompositeComplianceCUDA)"". It mentions that a specific test was disabled because it's failing in CI. So this is about a test failure issue.

In the body, they provide details about the platform (linux), links to CI logs, and mention that the test has been flaky with multiple failures. They also give debugging instructions and reference the test file path as `test_ops.py`. The problem seems to be related to a failing test in their test suite, specifically a CUDA-related test.

Now, looking at the patches provided. It's a code change where they added a condition before running some checks. Specifically, they check if all results are strided tensors with `all_results_strided = all(is_strided_tensor(result) for result in results)`. If this condition is true, then they proceed with creating output gradients and performing the backward pass with autograd.

So what's the issue here? The test was failing because it wasn't handling cases where some results might not be strided tensors. By adding this check, they're ensuring that the backward operations are only performed when all results are compatible, which would fix the flaky test.

Now, considering the labels in GitHub issues. Common labels include ""bug"", ""test failure"", ""runtime"", etc. The label assigned here is ""runtime"". I'm trying to think what ""runtime"" typically refers to. Usually, runtime issues are about problems that occur during execution, like crashes, performance issues, or unexpected behavior when running the code.

In this case, the problem was a failing test in CI, which suggests it's a test failure issue rather than a runtime error in production code. The patches fix the condition under which certain operations are performed, preventing the test from incorrectly handling non-strided tensors and thus causing failures.

So does ""runtime"" accurately capture that? Maybe not entirely. It feels more like a test reliability or bug where the test wasn't correctly handling certain tensor types. So perhaps labels like ""test failure"", ""bug"", or ""CI"" would be more appropriate than ""runtime"".

But sometimes, issues related to how code behaves during execution (like autograd operations) could fall under runtime. However, since this is about a test failing and not the actual code misbehaving at runtime for users, I'm leaning towards it being a test issue rather than a runtime one.

Therefore, the label ""runtime"" might not be the most accurate here.
</think>

The label assigned does not accurately reflect the issue because the problem pertains to a failing test in CI, which is more about test reliability or a bug in testing rather than a general runtime issue.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39226,forward port,JarEntry.getComment() returns incorrect result from NestedJarFile instances,Forward port of issue #39166 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. 

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""JarEntry.getComment() returns incorrect result from NestedJarFile instances."" So, the problem is about a method returning wrong results when dealing with NestedJarFile instances. That suggests it's a bug fix rather than a new feature.

The body says, ""Forward port of issue #39166 to 3.3.x."" This immediately tells me that this issue is taking something from another version (probably a fix or change) and applying it to the 3.3.x branch. So the primary purpose here is to bring an existing solution into a different codebase or version.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies some lines in a file related to how comments are read from zip entries. It changes the condition for checking the comment length and adjusts where it reads the comment from. This seems like a bug fix to correctly handle comments when using NestedJarFile.

Patch 2 adds a test case that creates a JAR file, writes some entries with comments, and then checks if both the JDK's JarFile and the project's NestedJarFile return the same comments. The test ensures that after the fix, the behavior aligns with what's expected, confirming it's a bug fix.

Putting this together: the issue is about fixing a bug where getComment() doesn't work right in NestedJarFile instances. The body mentions it's a forward port, meaning they took a fix from another branch (like main) and applied it to 3.3.x. The patches are indeed fixing that issue by adjusting how comments are read and adding a test to verify the fix.

So, the label ""forward port"" is correct because the issue involves taking an existing fix and applying it to another version branch. It's not introducing a new feature or just a regular bug fix without being a port.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it involves forwarding a fix from one branch to another.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""testing"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""DISABLED test_second_order_accurate (__main__.TestGradient)"". That immediately tells me that a specific test named test_second_order_accurate in the TestGradient class has been disabled. The word ""DISABLED"" suggests that this test was turned off, probably because it was failing.

Looking at the body of the issue, it mentions that the test was disabled because it's failing on the main branch, with a link provided to recent failures. This reinforces that the problem is related to a failing test case. The body also CCs several people, which is common in GitHub issues to notify collaborators or experts who might be able to help.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. There's only one patch provided here. It shows two changes: an import statement for torch was added, and a decorator was added to the test_second_order_accurate method. The decorator is @torch._dynamo.config.patch(use_numpy_random_stream=True). This suggests that the test was failing because of some inconsistency in random number generation, possibly due to non-deterministic behavior affecting test reliability.

So, putting it all together: The issue was about a disabled test that was failing, and the fix involved modifying the test by adding a configuration to control random streams. This makes sense because tests, especially those involving numerical computations or machine learning, often require deterministic behavior to ensure consistent results across runs. Without such controls, flaky tests can occur where failures are intermittent.

The label assigned is ""testing"". Considering that this issue revolves around a test being disabled and then fixed by adjusting its configuration, it's clear that the problem is related to testing infrastructure or test reliability. The changes made are within the test code itself, aimed at ensuring the test passes consistently.

Therefore, the label ""testing"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue because it pertains to test cases, their execution, and their reliability. It's not about a bug in the main codebase but specifically about the tests themselves.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is showing.

First, looking at the issue report's title: it says something about an HTTP error when trying to access a specific URL. The user provided a stack trace from their program, which indicates that there's an issue with the 'net/http' package in Go, specifically mentioning a 404 Not Found error for ""http://10.240.0.1/healthz"". 

Now, moving on to the patches made to the repository. I see multiple changes across different files and modules. Let me go through some of them.

In patch 22, there's an update to a Go module: golang.org/x/mod was bumped from v0.18.0 to v0.19.0. Similarly, in patch 26 and 27, golang.org/x/sys is upgraded from v0.21.0 to v0.22.0. These are clear indications that dependencies are being updated.

Other patches show changes in code files, such as modifications to the `Report` struct where the 'Week' field's description was updated. There's also a change in how reports are handled during uploads, specifically around checking if a report already exists before proceeding. But these seem more like functional changes rather than dependency upgrades.

The key point here is that several patches involve updating Go modules to newer versions. This directly relates to the ""dependency upgrade"" label because it involves changing the versions of external libraries (dependencies) used by the project.

So, putting it all together: the issue report was resolved by upgrading some dependencies to their newer versions. The stack trace points to an error that might have been fixed in a later version of one of these modules. Therefore, applying these dependency upgrades would address the HTTP error encountered.

Thus, labeling this issue as ""dependency upgrade"" is appropriate because it accurately reflects the changes made to resolve the problem.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly captures the essence of the issue resolution since the patches involved updating Go modules to newer versions.

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

Starting with the title: ""Starting on 11/21 nightlies with inference_mode() gives black images using diffusers SD"". This clearly indicates an unexpected behavior where images are black when using certain configurations. That's a sign of a bug.

Looking at the body, the user describes that using specific versions of PyTorch (2.3.0.dev20231121+cu121 and later) with `inference_mode()` and `torch.compile()` results in black images or NOISE images. They also mention a runtime warning about invalid values when casting, which suggests something is wrong during the image processing.

The user provided a minimal reproducible example where enabling `torch.inference_mode()` causes issues, but disabling it works. This shows that the problem is tied to specific code paths in PyTorch when inference mode and compilation are used together.

The patches modify how scales are calculated in an upsample function. They change variable names from 'scales' to 'inv_scales' and adjust where scaling factors are applied, adding a check for None. This indicates that the root cause was incorrect handling of scaling values, leading to invalid computations that produced black images. The patch corrects this by properly inverting scales only when provided.

Since the issue is about unexpected behavior due to a code flaw, which was fixed with specific patches, labeling it as ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the report as it describes an unintended behavior resolved by code changes.

JuliaLang/julia,53021,regression,automatically generated counterexamples for `<:` transitivity,"Here's a Git repository containing a Julia package that generates counterexamples to the transitivity property that `<:` is supposed to satisfy:

<URL>

So far I tested it on v1.10 and v1.11-DEV: the results between these two versions are the same and may be found under `results/`. I'll give just two of the counterexamples here, see the rest on my repo:

This is the first counterexample in the results:

```The code snippet defines a counterexample triplet involving type tuples in Julia. Specifically:

1. `(Tuple{X, X} where X<:Union{})`: A tuple of two elements of the same type `X`, where `X` is a subtype of `Union{}`.
2. `(Tuple{C, C})`: A tuple of two elements of the same type `C`.
3. `(Tuple{X, X, Vararg{Any}} where C<:X<:C)`: A tuple of at least two elements of the same type `X`, with additional elements of any type, where `C` is a subtype of `X`, and `X` is a subtype of `C`.```

In the REPL:

```The code defines three tuple types with type parameters and constraints:

- `T1` is a tuple of two elements of the same type `X`, where `X` is a subtype of `Union{}`.
- `T2` is a tuple of two `C` elements.
- `T3` is a tuple of two elements of the same type `X`, followed by any number of elements of any type, where `C` is a subtype of `X`, which itself is a subtype of `C`.

The code then checks the subtype relationships:
- `T1` is a subtype of `T2`, which is a subtype of `T3`.
- `T1` is not a subtype of `T3`.```

This is the last counterexample in the results:

```The code snippet describes a counterexample triplet involving tuple types:

1. `Tuple{A, X, Vararg{X}} where X<:C`
2. `Tuple{Any, Vararg{C}}`
3. `Tuple{Any, Vararg{X}} where X>:C`

This represents a specific case used for testing or demonstrating some property or behavior in a type system or programming language.```

In the REPL:

```The code defines three tuple types with specific constraints and checks their subtype relationships. It creates:
- `T1` as a tuple of an `A`, an `X`, and variadic `X` where `X` is a subtype of `C`.
- `T2` as a tuple of `Any` and variadic `C`.
- `T3` as a tuple of `Any` and variadic `X` where `X` is a supertype of `C`.

It then verifies that `T1` is a subtype of `T2`, which is itself a subtype of `T3`, but `T1` is not a subtype of `T3`.```",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects this issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: It mentions something about Union normalization and typevar elimination causing incorrect subtyping results. From what I understand, a regression in software terms usually refers to a bug that was introduced after some changes, leading to a feature that previously worked no longer functioning correctly. So if this issue is about Union types not normalizing as expected and causing incorrect subtyping, it might be a regression.

Next, looking at the patches provided. There are several code changes in different files, especially related to type normalization and subtyping logic. For instance, Patch 1 modifies functions dealing with subtype checks and union normalization. This suggests that the issue was due to an error introduced in previous code, which now needs fixing. That aligns with a regression because it's about reverting or correcting something that went wrong after some updates.

Patch 3 includes changes in functions like `subtype_var` and `obvious_subtype`, adding checks for leaf bounds of type variables. This seems to address cases where the subtyping logic was incorrectly allowing certain type relations, which could be a regression if these were previously handled correctly but started failing after some code changes.

Patch 4 adds new test cases related to Union normalization issues. These tests are meant to ensure that specific Union and typevar scenarios work as intended, which implies that prior behavior wasn't correct—again pointing towards a regression.

Patch 5 modifies existing test cases, adding more checks for issues like diagonal rule applications and Union subtyping. This further supports the idea that there were failing or incorrect behaviors that needed fixing, consistent with a regression scenario.

The label ""regression"" is typically used when a bug causes functionality to break that was working before. Given the patches are about correcting Union normalization and typevar elimination which led to incorrect subtyping, it seems like these issues arose after some changes in the codebase. Therefore, this problem fits the definition of a regression because it's addressing unintended side effects from previous updates.

So, considering all these factors—the nature of the issue being related to bugs introduced by prior changes, and the patches aimed at correcting them—I think the label ""regression"" is appropriate.

pytorch/pytorch,123257,bug,Setting output_size argument during forward breaks LazyConvTranspose,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

I get an error when running the following snippet on PyTorch version 2.2.2 but not on 2.1.0:
```The code imports necessary modules from PyTorch, initializes a tensor `x` with random values, creates a `LazyConvTranspose2d` layer with 64 output channels and kernel size 2x2, and attempts to apply the layer to `x` with a specified output size of (33, 33). This results in an error in PyTorch version 2.2.2 but works without error in version 2.1.0.```
Here is the traceback for ver. 2.2.2:
```The log shows a `TypeError` raised when attempting to call `_LazyConvXdMixin.initialize_parameters()` with an unexpected keyword argument `output_size`. The error occurs within the PyTorch module system during the initialization of a convolutional layer.```
Same thing also happens when using 1d or 3d versions of LazyConvTranspose.

I also noticed that passing output_size as positional argument breaks things in both versions (maybe this happens in other versions also, but I haven't tested them):
```The code imports necessary modules from PyTorch, initializes a 4D tensor `x`, creates a `LazyConvTranspose2d` layer with 64 output channels and kernel size 2x2, and attempts to apply the layer to `x` with output shape (33, 33), which results in an error.```

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the problem description.

The user reported that when they tried to use `nn.LazyConvTranspose2d` with an `output_size` argument during the forward pass, it threw a TypeError. They provided a code snippet where calling `module(input, output_size=(...))` resulted in an error because the `initialize_parameters` method didn't accept the necessary arguments.

Looking at the patches, two changes were made:

1. In the test cases, new tests (`test_lazy_conv_transpose1d_kwargs`, etc.) were added that pass `output_size` as a keyword argument to `_check_lazy_conv`. This suggests that the testing framework now correctly handles cases where such arguments are passed during the forward pass.

2. The method `initialize_parameters` was modified to accept `*args` and `**kwargs`, allowing it to handle additional parameters like `output_size`.

These changes indicate that the original issue was due to a missing functionality or an oversight in how parameters were handled. Specifically, the `LazyConvTranspose` modules couldn't process keyword arguments necessary for proper operation during initialization.

Since the problem was resolved by updating the method signatures and tests to accommodate these arguments, it confirms that there was indeed a bug in the codebase. The inability to pass required parameters like `output_size` without causing an error is a clear defect, which fits under the ""bug"" label.
</think>

The issue was caused by a missing ability to handle keyword arguments during the initialization of lazy convolution transpose modules. The patches added support for these arguments and updated tests accordingly, confirming it as a bug.

pytorch/pytorch,136090,enhancement,Tensor `isin` and `unique` missing bfloat16 support and half support on CPU,"### 🚀 The feature, motivation and pitch

Noticed this odd gap in coverage when looking at optests: <URL>

Not sure why we don't have kernels build here for bfloat16 (or more types in CPU for that matter).

* This blocked by lack of GPU support for bfloat16 for unique, so I also added that in my fix PR

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional context

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, I'll look at the title: ""Tensor `isin` and `unique` missing bfloat16 support and half support on CPU."" So the issue is about adding support for certain data types (bfloat16 and half) on CPUs for these tensor functions. That sounds like a feature request because it's about expanding functionality to support more data types.

Next, I'll read the body of the issue. The user noticed missing coverage in tests and mentions that they added GPU support for bfloat16 in their fix PR. They also provided alternatives but didn't list any, so maybe there aren't other options. The context isn't extensive, but it's clear this is about adding new functionality.

Now looking at the patches. Patch 1 modifies a template to include BFloat16 and Half. Patches 2 through 7 adjust function calls and dispatchers to handle these types on CPU and CUDA. These changes are adding support where it was missing before, which is characteristic of enhancements or feature additions rather than bug fixes.

The label assigned is ""enhancement,"" which typically refers to new features or improvements. Since the issue is about adding support for more data types, this fits as an enhancement rather than a bug fix. Bug fixes usually address issues causing incorrect behavior, but here it's expanding functionality.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to enhancing functionality by adding support for new data types.

* ReflectionObject
* ReflectionParameter (2 leaks)
* ReflectionProperty


### PHP Version

8.5-dev

### Operating System

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title of the issue: ""Memory leak in Reflection constructors"". That immediately tells me that the problem is related to memory not being properly released, which fits under a memory leak.

Next, I'll read through the body of the issue. The user provided some PHP code that when run results in a memory leak detection. They included the output showing that there was one memory leak detected. They also mentioned that they tested other Reflection classes like ReflectionExtension, ReflectionObject, and ReflectionParameter, which also had leaks. This confirms that the issue is indeed about memory not being freed correctly.

Now looking at the patches provided. There are several patches here. Patch 1 adds a note about fixing a bug related to a memory leak in Reflection constructors. The other patches (2 through 6) include changes to how certain reflection objects are constructed and destroyed, particularly around freeing references and parameters properly. For example, in Patch 2, there's code that releases strings and frees allocated memory when reflection objects are destroyed. This directly addresses preventing memory leaks by ensuring proper cleanup.

Additionally, the test cases added in Patches 3-6 check if double constructor calls on Reflection objects don't cause issues, which would prevent potential memory leaks from multiple initializations without proper cleanup.

Putting it all together: The issue title and body describe a memory leak, and the patches implement fixes that free allocated resources correctly. Therefore, the label ""memory leak"" is appropriate because both the problem described and the solution address memory management issues.
</think>

The label ""memory leak"" accurately reflects the issue as it deals with improper memory handling in Reflection constructors, confirmed by the provided description, test results, and patches.

nodejs/node,52159,bug,Recursive fs.readdirSync tries to recurse into Unix domain socket,"### Version

v21.7.1

### Platform

Darwin nathan-MacBook-Pro 23.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:31:00 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020 arm64

### Subsystem

fs

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

The following snippet will reproduce the bug on macOS and Linux; I'm not able to test it on Windows:

```This code snippet removes and creates a directory, sets up a Unix domain socket server, and logs the files in the directory both non-recursively and recursively.```

### How often does it reproduce? Is there a required condition?

It reproduces consistently for me.

### What is the expected behavior? Why is that the expected behavior?

I would expect to see output like the following:

```The log indicates that in both non-recursive and recursive searches, the file `file.sock` was found.```

In both the recursive and non-recursive case, listing a directory with a single file in it should produce an array containing that file's name.

### What do you see instead?

Instead, I see the following output:

```The log indicates that an attempt was made to read the directory contents of `dir/file.sock`, but it failed because `dir/file.sock` is not a directory. The error occurred while trying to read files in a non-recursive manner, and the specific file that caused the issue is `file.sock`.```

### Additional information

For some reason, it's treating a Unix domain socket as a directory and it tries to call `scandir` on it, which is clearly not valid.

To confirm that `dir/file.sock` created by the above script is indeed a socket, I ran the following (output shown below the command):

```The log indicates that `dir/file.sock` is identified as a socket file.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report based on the provided information.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""Recursive fs.readdirSync tries to recurse into Unix domain socket."" This immediately suggests that there's an unexpected behavior happening when using a specific function in Node.js. The word ""tries to recurse"" implies that something is going wrong during the execution, which points towards a bug.

Moving on to the body of the report. The user provided steps to reproduce the issue, including code snippets and error messages. They mentioned that running this code consistently causes an ENOTDIR error because fs.readdirSync with recursive set to true attempts to treat a Unix domain socket as a directory. This is clearly not expected behavior—sockets shouldn't be treated as directories by file system functions.

The user also provided the expected output, which is just listing the socket file without any issues, and what they actually saw was an error because the function tried to scan the socket as if it were a directory. This discrepancy indicates a problem with how Node.js handles certain file types when using recursive readdir.

Looking at the patches that resolved this issue: 

Patch 1 changes how the code checks if something is a directory, replacing a bitwise AND with S_ISDIR, which is more standard and reliable. Similarly, Patch 2 corrects another condition to properly check for directories using S_IFMT and S_IFDIR. These changes suggest that the original code had incorrect checks for directories, leading it to mistakenly treat sockets as such.

Patch 3 adds a test case to ensure this behavior doesn't regress. It creates a server with a Unix domain socket and attempts to read the directory recursively without crashing or causing errors, which directly addresses the issue reported.

Considering all of these factors—the unexpected error when using recursive readdir on a directory containing a socket, the patches fixing how directories are checked, and the addition of a test case—it's clear that this was indeed a bug in Node.js. The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem described because it involves incorrect functionality that was fixed with specific code changes.

rust-lang/rust,127539,panic,Fix panic=abort tests on Fuchsia,"#127461 disabled these tests on Fuchsia:

* tests/ui/test-attrs/test-panic-abort-nocapture.rs
* tests/ui/test-attrs/test-panic-abort.rs

They were disabled because they were failing due to a message printed to stderr about the exit code being -1028 (ZX_TASK_RETCODE_EXCEPTION_KILL), coming from [this line in libtest](<URL> (oops).

We can clean up this error message, because it's an expected result of a panic in any unit test, and re-enable the test-panic-abort tests. We just need to add a match arm with `#[cfg(target_os = ""fuchsia"")]` that detects the failure code used for fuchsia (-1028) and returns TestResult::TrFailed with no message.








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

First, the title of the issue is ""Fix panic=abort tests on Fuchsia."" That clearly mentions ""panic,"" which relates to testing abort scenarios in Rust, probably when a test panics and needs to handle it gracefully.

Looking at the body, it explains that certain tests were disabled because they failed due to an error message. The error came from a specific line in the library/test code where a panic occurs. The solution proposed is to clean up this error by handling the exit code specific to Fuchsia and re-enabling the tests. So the issue is about properly handling panics in tests on Fuchsia.

Now, examining the patches: 

Patch 1 adds a constant for the Fuchsia-specific return code (-1028) and modifies how test results are determined. It checks if the exit code matches this specific value and returns TrFailed without a message, which I assume is meant to handle the panic gracefully instead of showing an error.

Patches 2 and 3 seem to adjust the line numbers in the test files where the panics occur. This suggests that the tests were failing because the expected behavior wasn't correctly handled on Fuchsia, so adjusting where the panic is thrown or caught might fix the test execution.

Putting it all together: The issue is about fixing tests related to panics (specifically when aborting) on Fuchsia by properly handling their exit codes. The label ""panic"" captures this essence because the problem revolves around how panics in tests are managed and reported, especially ensuring that such cases don't cause unintended failures or error messages.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the issue report.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41938,metrics,Upgrade to Dropwizard Metrics 4.2.27,,1,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""metrics"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. The issue title is ""Upgrade to Dropwizard Metrics 4.2.27"", and the body is empty. So, from the title alone, it's clear that the issue is about upgrading a library related to metrics.

Looking at the patch provided, it changes the version of ""Dropwizard Metrics"" from 4.2.26 to 4.2.27 in a build file. This confirms that the issue was indeed about updating the Metrics library.

The label assigned is ""metrics"". Since Dropwizard Metrics is a metrics-related library and the issue involves upgrading its version, the label seems relevant. It categorizes the issue under metrics, which makes sense because it's directly related to the functionality or dependency of metrics in the project.

I don't see any reason why this label wouldn't fit. The title and patch both point towards a metrics-related change, so using the ""metrics"" label accurately reflects the content of the issue.
</think>

The label ""metrics"" is appropriate because the issue involves upgrading Dropwizard Metrics, which is directly related to metrics functionality.

denoland/deno,26313,build,Build fails Next.js static exports,"Build fails when using [static exports](<URL> in Next.js.

```The log shows that a build task for a Next.js 14.2.15 project was executed successfully, but encountered an error during the generation of static pages. Specifically, the build failed because it could not find the file `/Users/moriken/Developer/next-app/out/_next/static/css/9de320161955c026.css`, resulting in a ""No such file or directory"" error.```

After that, the relevant file is existing, which suggests that a race condition is occurring [here](<URL> 
It works fine in Node.js 22.9.0.

1. Build

    ```The code snippet shows that running a `build` task using Deno version 2.0.0 fails, while the same task successfully runs with Node.js version 22.9.0.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""build"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the issue's title, body, and the provided patches.

The title is ""Build fails Next.js static exports."" That immediately tells me that the problem occurs during the build process when using static exports in Next.js. 

Looking at the body, the user describes a build failure with an error message indicating a file not found during the static pages generation. They mention it works fine on Node.js 22.9.0 but fails on Deno 2.0.0. The error points to a race condition in the `recursive-copy.ts` file. 

The patches provided are modifications to functions related to copying files. Patch 1 adjusts how errors are handled when a file isn't found, specifically for both asynchronous and synchronous copy operations. It adds conditional checks to only throw an error if it's not a ""NotFound"" case, which suggests it's trying to handle race conditions where the file might exist by the time the error is processed.

Patch 2 introduces new tests for `copyFile` with the `COPYFILE_EXCL` flag. These tests check that copying a file when the destination already exists throws an appropriate error, ensuring exclusive copy behavior works as expected.

So, the issue revolves around a build failure due to file handling during static exports. The patches modify how files are copied and tested, directly addressing the race condition causing the build to fail. 

The label ""build"" is assigned because the problem occurs during the build process. However, I think a more specific label like ""bug"" or ""race-condition"" might be better, but since the options aren't given, I have to assess if ""build"" captures the essence.

Given that the issue is about the build failing and the patches fix the build process, the label ""build"" does accurately reflect the problem. It's a high-level category that correctly groups this type of issue.
</think>

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""rendering"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report and the patches applied. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Inspector Tools issue when view are transformed in Fabric."" It mentions Inspector Tools and views being transformed, which relates to how elements are displayed and inspected.

In the body, the user explains that when using vertical inversion, the wrong element is highlighted because `findNodeAtPoint` isn't accounting for the transform. This affects both iOS and Android. The steps to reproduce involve toggling the element inspector and selecting an item, where the expected highlight doesn't match the actual one.

The patches provided are in C++ files. Patch 1 modifies the `findNodeAtPoint` function by adjusting how points are calculated when there's a vertical or horizontal inversion. It includes adding transformations and normalizing coordinates based on the center of the frame. This suggests that the issue is about correctly mapping touch points to elements, especially under transformations.

Patch 2 adds a test case for an inverted list, checking if the correct element is found at specific points after applying a vertical inversion transform. This indicates that the problem lies in how the inspector tool calculates which node is under the pointer when views are transformed.

Patch 3 updates functions `isVerticalInversion` and `isHorizontalInversion` to use float comparison instead of direct equality checks, ensuring accurate detection of inversions.

The original label was ""rendering,"" but the issue isn't about how elements are rendered visually. Instead, it's about the inspector tool correctly identifying elements when transformations are applied. The core problem affects the interaction and inspection tools rather than the visual rendering pipeline.

So, I think the correct labels should relate to ""inspector"" or ""tools"" since the problem is with the element inspector not working as expected due to transform issues.
</think>

The issue revolves around the Inspector Tools incorrectly identifying elements when transformations are applied. The patches address how touch points are calculated under such transforms, affecting the tool's functionality rather than rendering.

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)



This is reported by one of our user:

```The SQL query selects aggregated metrics from the `information_schema.cluster_SLOW_QUERY` table for queries executed between '2024-06-24 10:20:00' and '2024-06-24 10:30:00', filtered by internal status and coprocessor address. It groups the results by `user` and `digest`, orders them by `Total_keys` in descending order, and limits the output to the top 10 rows. The query encounters an error due to a panic in the RPC server handling the coprocessor, specifically a runtime error with an index out of range issue.```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Query success

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Query failed

The panic stack is this:

```The log indicates a warning and an informational message related to a database operation failure. The warning occurred at `[2024/06/24 12:33:25.051 +08:00]` and suggests that there was an ""other error"" during a coprocessor handling process by the RPC server. The error message includes a runtime index out of range issue at index 8192. This error originated from `coprocessor.go:1187`. The informational message at `[2024/06/24 12:33:25.052 +08:00]` confirms that the command dispatch failed for a specific connection, detailing the SQL query and the exact error encountered, which aligns with the previous warning.```

The real panic stack is this one:

```The log indicates that a panic occurred in the TiDB RPC server while handling a coprocessor request. The panic originated from the `readLastLines` function in `slow_query.go`, which is part of the TiDB executor module. The stack trace shows a series of function calls leading up to the panic, involving components such as slow query retrieval, file time retrieval, and coprocessor handling.```

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""select from information_schema.CLUSTER_SLOW_QUERY panic"". The word ""panic"" here suggests that something went wrong, possibly a crash or an unexpected error in the system. That definitely sounds like a bug because it's an unintended behavior causing the program to fail.

Next, the body of the report provides more details. There's a SQL query provided that's causing an error with code 1105, which is ""other error: panic when RPC server handling coprocessor"". The user expected the query to succeed but instead got this panic error. This indicates that there's a problem in how the system handles certain queries, leading to a crash. That’s a clear sign of a bug.

Then, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 modifies the `readLastLines` function in `slow_query.go`. It changes a loop condition and some bounds checking. The original code had a loop that might have gone out of bounds, which could cause an index error. By adjusting the loop to run until `len(chars)-1` and adding proper checks for newline characters without exceeding array limits, this patch likely fixes an issue where accessing an invalid index was causing a panic.

Patch 2 adds a test case named `TestIssue54324`, which seems to verify that reading specific file sizes doesn't cause panics. This suggests that the original problem was related to how files were read, possibly leading to buffer overflows or incorrect indexing when handling large files, which aligns with the index out of range error mentioned in the issue.

Putting it all together: The issue is about a panic occurring during a specific SQL query, and the patches address potential index errors and add tests to prevent such panics. This clearly points to an unintended behavior in the code, so labeling it as a bug makes sense.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report because it describes an unexpected error causing a system panic, and the provided patches fix the underlying indexing issues that led to the crash.

What I would've expected is something closer to this (an unstable non-`const` function):
![image](<URL>

For reference, functions stable in non-`const` contexts but unstable in `const` contexts look like this:
![image](<URL>








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""layout"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Confusing rustdoc layout for `const` functions that are unstable even in non-`const` contexts."" The word ""layout"" is right there in the title, which suggests that the problem is related to how something looks or is arranged in the documentation. So that's a hint that the label might be appropriate.

Now, the body of the issue includes some images. From what I can gather without seeing them, the user is pointing out that the rustdoc (Rust's documentation generator) is displaying `const` functions in a way that's confusing. They provide examples of what they found versus what they expected. This implies that the issue is about the visual presentation or structure of the documentation, which again ties into layout.

Next, looking at the patches provided to fix this issue. There are five patches, and I'll try to understand what each does without getting too deep into the code.

Patch 1 seems to modify how constness is determined in the code. It changes a condition that checks if a function is both `const` and not unstable, to now include cases where it's either `const` or unstable. This affects whether the function is marked as `Const` or `NotConst`. So this might influence how rustdoc displays these functions.

Patch 2 updates imports to include `StableSince`, which suggests that stability information (like since which version a feature is stable) will now be considered in the documentation rendering.

Patch 3 modifies the `print_constness_with_space` function. It changes how constness and stability are printed. Previously, it checked if the function was `const` and had some stability status. Now, it seems to handle cases where a function is unstable or stable differently, especially considering both overall stability and const stability. This directly affects the text output in the documentation.

Patch 4 adds debug information and modifies how `print_constness_with_space` is called by passing more parameters related to stability. Again, this ties into how the documentation displays function properties.

Patch 5 adds some test cases. One of them uses `#[rustc_const_unstable]`, which marks a const function as unstable. The tests check that certain spans don't appear in the generated HTML, indicating that the documentation isn't showing the 'since' version for these cases. This suggests that the patches are ensuring that unstable functions aren't marked with version info when they shouldn't be.

Putting it all together, the issue is about how rustdoc displays `const` functions, particularly those that are unstable. The confusion arises from the layout—how the stability and constness are presented. The patches adjust the conditions under which certain keywords or notes are displayed in the documentation, ensuring that the layout accurately reflects whether a function is stable or unstable, both in general and in its const context.

So, considering all this, the label ""layout"" does seem appropriate because the problem and solution revolve around how information is presented visually in the generated documentation. The changes aren't about adding new features or fixing bugs in functionality but rather improving how information is displayed to avoid confusion.

spring-projects/spring-framework,34119,bug,Dependency injection matches wildcards too leniently with 6.2.1,"Steps to reproduce:

1. Define two interfaces `ObjectPostProcessor  `and `AuthorizationManager`

```The code defines two interfaces:

1. `ObjectPostProcessor<T>` with a method `process(T t)` to process an object of type `T`.
2. `AuthorizationManager<T>` with a method `getValue()` to retrieve a value of type `T`.```


2. SimpleStart as config class

```The code defines a class `SimpleStart` that implements `ApplicationContextAware`. It declares two static methods annotated with `@Bean` to create instances of `ObjectPostProcessor`. The `setApplicationContext` method retrieves and prints an instance of one of these processors from the application context.```

3.  Run

```The log indicates an error while creating a bean named `simpleStart` because there are two beans of type `cn.hiboot.framework.research.spring.research.ObjectPostProcessor<java.lang.Object>` available, but the configuration expects only one.```

It does work well when I replaced `?`  with `Object`, I wonder if this scene needs to be supported in the future?

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label 'bug' is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Dependency injection matches wildcards too leniently with 6.2.1"". The word ""too leniently"" suggests that there's an issue where something isn't working as it should. That sounds like a bug because it's unexpected behavior.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user provided steps to reproduce the problem. They defined two interfaces and a config class. When they run their test, they get a BeanCreationException because Spring can't find a single matching bean when there are two available. This indicates that the dependency injection isn't working correctly, which points to a bug in how Spring handles these generics or wildcards.

The user also mentions that it worked before a specific change (#33982), implying that something was broken by an update, which is typical of regression bugs. They relate this issue to another one in Spring Security, further suggesting it's a problem within the framework.

Looking at the patches provided: they made changes to how ResolvableType handles generics and wildcards. The modifications include checking if types are assignable and handling unresolved type variables more strictly. These are code fixes aimed at correcting incorrect behavior, which is exactly what you do for bugs.

So putting it all together: the issue describes unexpected behavior causing errors, provides reproduction steps, links to prior changes that introduced the problem, and shows patches meant to fix incorrect handling of dependency injection with generics. All these elements point towards this being a bug rather than, say, an enhancement or feature request.
</think>

The label 'bug' accurately reflects the issue as it describes unexpected behavior in the framework's dependency injection system, provides steps to reproduce, links to prior changes that introduced the problem, and includes patches aimed at correcting the behavior.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, let's look at the title of the issue: ""[CI] LogsdbTestSuiteIT class failing"". This suggests that there's a problem with some test cases in the LogsdbTestSuiteIT class, which is part of the Continuous Integration (CI) process. So it's related to tests failing during CI builds.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. The user provided build scans and a reproduction command. They also mentioned that the failure occurs specifically on branch 8.16, with a failure rate of 3.7% in 54 executions for the class, and 100% fail rate in 2 executions for the pipeline. 

The key part is the failure message:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Failure at [/30_logsdb_default_mapping:522]: got unexpected warning header [
	299 Elasticsearch-8.16.0-5972cff67544c4464f02346acf93aed94647f270 ""index template [logs-template] has index patterns [logs-win-prod] matching patterns from existing older templates [global] with patterns (global => [*]); this template [logs-template] will take precedence during new index creation""
]
```
This shows that the test is failing due to an AssertionError. The error message indicates that there's an unexpected warning related to index templates in Elasticsearch.

Looking at the patches, each one modifies the allowed_warnings section of various test cases. For example, in Patch 1:
- The original line allowed a warning with patterns [logs-*-*].
- It was changed to allow a more specific pattern like [logs-http-prod].

So the patches are adjusting which warnings the tests expect, making them more specific instead of using wildcards. This suggests that the test was failing because it encountered an unexpected warning message that wasn't accounted for in the allowed_warnings list.

Now, considering what ""runtime error"" means: typically, a runtime error refers to an error that occurs during the execution of the program, such as exceptions or crashes. However, this issue is specifically about a test failure due to an assertion error caused by unexpected warnings, not a crash or exception in the code itself.

The label ""runtime error"" might be too broad here. The problem isn't a general runtime issue but rather a test failure because of unanticipated warnings during CI testing. A more accurate label might be something like ""test failure"" or ""CI issue,"" as it's specifically related to test cases failing due to unexpected conditions.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" doesn't precisely capture the nature of this problem. It was assigned but doesn't reflect that the issue is a test failure rather than an application crash or runtime exception.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" does not accurately reflect the issue because it's specifically about a test failure due to unexpected warnings, not a general runtime error.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what a regression is in software terms. A regression usually means that a bug has been introduced or an existing feature has stopped working after some code changes, often as a result of new development or refactoring.

Looking at the issue title: ""[Queries as signals]: Signal Queries throws console errors when component is rendered as custom element"". This suggests that there's a problem with signal queries causing errors in specific circumstances, like using custom elements.

In the body, the user explains that when a component uses `contentQuery` and is rendered as a custom element, it breaks with console errors. They mention that this shouldn't happen because existing decorators return empty arrays or undefined. So, they're pointing out unexpected behavior that's causing errors.

The user also mentions that it's a regression, which implies that this was working before but now isn't. They provided environment details and a stackblitz link to reproduce the issue. The error message shows an undefined property being read, indicating something went wrong in how content queries are handled when using custom elements.

Now looking at the patches. Patch 1 removes an import related to EffectScheduler, which might not directly cause this issue but could be part of the fix. Patch 2 adjusts how `executeContentQueries` is called and modifies some imports. It looks like they're changing parameters passed into functions, possibly fixing incorrect references or ensuring proper initialization. Patch 3 adds a test case for dynamically created components, specifically checking that content queries return empty results when expected.

The key here is whether this issue represents a regression. The user states it's a regression because the behavior changed from correctly handling `contentChildren` and `contentChild` to now throwing errors. The patches seem to adjust how content queries are executed, possibly reverting or correcting changes that introduced the bug.

Since the problem arose after some code change (as indicated by the regression), and the patches aim to fix this unexpected behavior, labeling it as a regression makes sense.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that fixed it.

First, let's look at the issue itself. The title is ""Angular.dev Playground is broken."" That sounds like something isn't working as expected on the Angular playground site. In the body, the user mentions that when they navigate to the playground, the code doesn't populate in main.ts and game.html. They also provided a screenshot and an error log pointing to a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length'). This suggests there's a runtime error happening when trying to load or run something on the site.

The user marked it as a regression, which typically means that a bug was introduced in a recent change that wasn't present before. They also didn't provide an environment but linked directly to the playground, indicating it's a problem with the live site.

Now, looking at the patch provided. It modifies a Bazel build file, specifically a rule related to filtering external npm dependencies. The changes include adding a check for problematic transitive dependencies and adjusting how packages are routed into node_modules. This seems like an internal build or dependency management issue that could affect how the Angular playground is built or served.

The key here is whether this bug was introduced by a recent change (regression) or if it's a new issue without prior context. Since the user marked it as a regression, they believe it's a new problem caused by a change. The patches seem to address dependency routing issues, which could explain why the playground isn't loading correctly—maybe a missing or incorrect dependency is causing the code not to populate and the error to occur.

So, considering all this, the label ""regression"" fits because the bug appears to have been introduced after some changes, affecting functionality that was previously working. The patches aim to correct how dependencies are handled, which likely fixes the regression.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39466,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring Security 6.1.7,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, the title of the issue is ""Upgrade to Spring Security 6.1.7"". That immediately tells me that the issue is about updating a dependency in the project. The body is empty, so there's no additional context there, but the patches provided are crucial.

Looking at Patch 1, I see that it modifies a line in what looks like a build configuration file (maybe Gradle or Maven). The change is from ""6.1.7-SNAPSHOT"" to ""6.1.7"". This indicates that they're moving away from a snapshot version, which is typically a development or unstable version, to a stable release.

So the action here is clearly about upgrading a dependency (Spring Security) from a SNAPSHOT version to a released version. The label ""dependency upgrade"" fits because it's specifically about updating the version of a library used in the project. There's no mention of new features, bug fixes outside of dependencies, or other types of changes that might require different labels like ""bug fix"" or ""feature request"".

I don't see any reason to doubt this labeling. The title and patch both point directly to a dependency upgrade without any ambiguity.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to upgrading a project dependency.

FuelLabs/sway,6320,unsoundness,Incorrect function purity check,"Reclassify to High

From <URL>

# Brief/Intro
check_function_purity incorrectly checks the function's purity, allowing a function with only a storage(read) to potentially modify the state.

# Vulnerability Details
check_function_purity recursively traverses all reachable instructions within the function and the functions it calls to verify the correctness of the storage read write tags marked on the function. However, during the verification of the asm block, it incorrectly identifies the scwq instruction as a read operation, leading to an erroneous verification result.
```This code snippet iterates over the operations in an assembly block and updates tuples tracking read and write operations based on the operation name. It uses pattern matching to determine whether an operation reads from or writes to memory, updating the respective tuple accordingly.```
Aside from the bug, we think doing storage checks statically is not a good idea. It is possible for a read-only function to call another contract, which then calls a write function in the original contract. This breaks the read-only assumption of read abi functions, but does not violate any checks. It is possible to refine the checks, but there are too many moving parts in the cross contract call for precise checking. For example, ldc is another instruction which can affect purity of functions. It will be easier if the fuel-vm maintains a flag to check against storage mutations during runtime, which is what ethereum does.

# Impact Details
It is hard to precisely estimate the impact of an incorrect purity check because it depends on the code the user writes. In the best-case scenario, benign developers can also unknowingly call storage modifying functions in read-only functions and change the contract storage. This is arguably the developer's fault, but it presents an opportunity where the sway compiler fails to deliver the promise of function purity checks, and may misdirect developers into thinking their code is fine. In the worst-case scenario, malicious developers can exploit this incorrect check to fool users into calling a function deemed read-only, but actually modifies the state, and leverage it to steal funds.

To be honest, we are not sure what impact is appropriate for this kind of ""missing checks"" bugs. Because in the end, developers must have made a mistake to even have a chance to set off, or in this case, not set off the compilation errors checks. But because the sway team repeatedly said they think cei-analysis and storage purity checks correctness are important, we think this qualifies as a critical bug.

# References
<URL>


# Proof of Concept
Tests are run on sway commit acded67b3ec77ce1753356ad46f7ae17290f2ee0.

Compiler should refuse to compile clear_storage function, however, due to the incorrect check, below test case will successfully run.
```The code snippet defines a smart contract with a storage variable `a` and an ABI method `test`. It includes an implementation of the `test` method that clears storage. There is a function `clear_storage` marked with `#[storage(read)]` which is intended to read from storage but attempts to write to it using assembly, causing a compile-time error due to incorrect attribute usage. The `test` function at the end calls `c.test()` to invoke the ABI method.```
We omit writing a dapp to show loss of funds caused by this bug, because the fuel team said we only need to show the incorrect compilation with our PoC in the changelog walkthrough earlier.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects the given issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is about.

The issue seems to be related to some patches made in a repository, likely involving a programming language or compiler project. The title mentions an issue report with several patches and a label assigned as ""unsoundness."" My task is to see if that label fits based on the provided information.

First, I should understand what ""unsoundness"" means in this context. In programming languages and type theory, unsoundness refers to a situation where a type system or other safety mechanisms allow operations that can lead to runtime errors or violate the expected safety properties. This is a serious issue because it undermines the reliability of the language.

Looking at the patches provided, I see several changes across different files. The first few patches seem to adjust dependencies and build configurations, which don't immediately indicate unsoundness. However, starting from patch 66, there are changes in trait implementations and function attributes related to storage.

Patch 66 introduces a struct S with an implementation of trait A. The function f() is annotated with #[storage(read)], and it loads a state using __state_load_word(). Then, an Abi trait defines test(), which calls S{}.g(). This might be where the problem arises because if g() isn't properly annotated or interacts incorrectly with storage attributes, it could lead to unsound behavior.

Patch 67 shows that in category ""fail,"" there's a check related to pure functions accessing storage. The error message suggests that function g() is pure but tries to access storage through self.f(). Since f() has #[storage(read)], calling it from a pure function without the proper attributes could indeed cause unsoundness, as the type system isn't enforcing the necessary constraints.

Other patches adjust comments and checks in test cases, possibly ensuring that certain operations are correctly optimized or validated. These might be part of fixing the unsoundness by adding proper annotations or checks to prevent invalid storage accesses.

The key point here is that if a function marked as pure (without storage attributes) calls another function that does have storage side effects, it can bypass the type system's guarantees. This would allow operations that should be prohibited, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior, which fits the definition of unsoundness.

Therefore, the label ""unsoundness"" seems appropriate because the issue revolves around ensuring the type system correctly enforces storage access rules and preventing functions from accessing storage in ways that violate their declared purity.
</think>

The label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects this issue report because it involves violations of the type system's safety guarantees due to improper storage access annotations, which can lead to runtime errors.

php/php-src,17047,memory leak,UAF on iconv filter failure,"### Description

The following code:

```This PHP code defines constants, functions, and filters a string through multiple iconv and rot13 filters before echoing the result. It also demonstrates the use of a closure and exception handling.```

Resulted in this output:
```The log indicates an `AddressSanitizer` error due to a heap-use-after-free issue. Specifically:

- The program reads from a freed memory location at address `0x60400004bc7c`.
- The memory was previously allocated but has been freed.
- The problematic code is located in `php_stream_bucket_delref` at line 152 of `filter.c`.
- The error occurs in the context of handling iconv stream filters and reading from a stream.

The log provides call stack information showing the sequence of function calls leading up to the error.```

But I expected this output instead:
```The provided code snippet is empty.```

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""memory leak"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""UAF on iconv filter failure."" UAF stands for Use-After-Free, which is a type of memory-related bug where a program accesses memory after it has been freed. This isn't exactly a memory leak, which is when memory is allocated but not properly released, leading to gradual memory consumption.

Next, the body of the issue provides a PHP script that triggers an error. The output shows an AddressSanitizer error indicating a heap-use-after-free at a specific address. This confirms that the bug is related to accessing memory after it's been freed, which aligns with a UAF vulnerability rather than a memory leak.

Looking at the patches applied, they modify how errors are handled in the iconv stream filter. Specifically, they change the error handling by returning PSFS_ERR_FATAL instead of using a goto statement that might leave some resources unreleased. This suggests that the problem was improper error handling leading to accessing buckets after they were freed, not an issue where memory wasn't being freed at all.

Patch 1 adds a note about fixing bug GH-17047 related to UAF in iconv filters. Patch 2 adjusts how errors are handled, ensuring that buckets are properly delref'ed before returning, preventing the use-after-free scenario. Patch 3 introduces a test case that triggers the issue and expects a warning related to an invalid multibyte sequence, which is consistent with an error during iconv conversion but not memory leakage.

So putting it all together: the bug is about accessing memory after it's been freed (UAF), not about memory leaking. Therefore, the label ""memory leak"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue. The correct label should relate to use-after-free or UAF.
</think>

The label ""memory leak"" does not accurately describe this issue. The problem is a Use-After-Free vulnerability, not a memory leak.

pytorch/pytorch,136291,bug,"On AMD GPUs (ROCm 5.7-6.2), cannot backpropagate loss tensor containing more than `2e8` elements","### 🐛 Describe the bug

In the following code, I am encountering a `HIP error` during backpropagation that is thrown when executing `bond_losses[atompair_mask].mean()`. I initially suspected (based on prior experience with e.g., AMD GPUs, namely the MI250x line) that this was caused by hardware/driver limitations for ROCm (n.b., issue reproduced with versions 5.7, 6.1, and 6.2), and adding the `if` clause below confirmed my suspicions since the issue during backpropagation has now disappeared as a result. I've made a pull request into [another GitHub repository](<URL> that makes use of this workaround for AMD GPUs.

```The code snippet defines a maximum number of elements (`MAX_ELEMENTS_FOR_BACKPROP`) for backpropagation and handles large input sizes by randomly selecting a subset of atom pair indices to compute losses, thus avoiding errors during backpropagation. If the number of true atom pairs exceeds this limit, it masks out a random selection of indices to stay within the limit. Finally, it calculates the mean loss using the masked bond losses.```

It's also worth noting that `2e8` isn't a precise threshold where this issue occurs. In practice, an `atompair_mask` of shape `[B, N, N]`, where `B=4` and `N≈8,600`, is in the range of tensor sizes where I started seeing this issue arise. To be on the safe side, I decided on setting `MAX_ELEMENTS_FOR_BACKPROP=int(2e8)` since this is close to setting the maximum size at `[4, 7000, 7000]`.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title says that on AMD GPUs with ROCm versions 5.7-6.2, there's a problem backpropagating a loss tensor with more than 2e8 elements. The user encountered a HIP error during backpropagation when using `bond_losses[atompair_mask].mean()`. They suspected hardware/driver limitations and confirmed it by adding an if-clause that worked around the issue.

In the body, they provided code showing how they sub-sampled data to avoid the error. They mentioned setting a MAX_ELEMENTS threshold because larger tensors caused HIP errors. The environment details show they're using PyTorch with ROCm 6.2 and AMD MI250X GPUs. They also linked to another repo where they applied a workaround.

Looking at the patches, Patch 1 modifies a kernel launch in CUDA/ROCm code. It adds conditional checks for workgroup size, adjusting blocks and processing remaining elements in a loop to prevent invalid configurations. This seems like a fix to handle large tensor sizes without causing HIP errors. Patch 2 adds a test case for large tensors on CUDA, ensuring the issue doesn't recur.

The label assigned is ""bug."" A bug typically refers to an unintended behavior or defect in the code. Here, the problem arises from how PyTorch handles large tensors on AMD GPUs, leading to HIP errors. The patches fix this by adjusting kernel launches and adding tests, which addresses the root cause.

So yes, the issue describes a bug where certain operations fail on specific hardware under given conditions, and the patches resolve it. Therefore, the label ""bug"" is accurate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it describes a defect in handling large tensors on AMD GPUs, which was fixed by code changes.

Can you please make the necessary updates to pickup the [patch](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the provided issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the patches, Patch 37 seems to involve some changes related to an SVG pan library. It's a go.mod file where one line is removed: github.com/google/pprof/third_party/d3flamegraph and another line is present: github.com/google/pprof/third_party/svgpan. Wait, no, looking again, actually in Patch 38, the line for d3flamegraph is commented out with a #, which means it's being excluded or removed from the dependencies.

Wait, in the go.mod file, lines starting with '#' are comments, not actual dependencies. So in the original version (Patch 37), there was an explicit comment line for github.com/ianlancetaylor/demangle, and another line for d3flamegraph which is commented out. Then in Patch 38, it seems that the d3flamegraph line is removed because it's now a comment, but wait no: looking at the context, in the go.mod file, lines are either modules or comments.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again:

In Patch 37, the go.mod includes:
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/d3flamegraph
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/svgpan

Then in Patch 38, the d3flamegraph line is commented out with a #, indicating it's no longer needed. So the change involves modifying the dependencies by removing one and keeping another.

Wait, but actually, looking at the go.mod content:

In the initial version (before), we have:
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/d3flamegraph
github.com/google/pprof/third_party/svgpan

Then in the updated version (after), the d3flamegraph line is commented out with a #, and the svgpan line remains.

Wait no, looking at the actual patches:

Patch 38 shows that the line for d3flamegraph is now preceded by a #, which means it's commented out. So in the go.mod file, it was previously uncommented (a dependency) and now it's commented (not a dependency anymore). The svgpan line remains as is.

So this indicates that the project is removing the d3flamegraph dependency and possibly upgrading or keeping the svgpan one.

The issue report's title isn't given, but based on the patches, it seems to be about updating dependencies. The label ""dependency upgrade"" suggests that they're updating versions of existing dependencies or adding new ones.

In this case, the project is removing d3flamegraph and perhaps upgrading svgpan, or just adjusting which dependencies are used. So the action involves modifying dependencies, specifically upgrading or changing them.

Therefore, the label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate because it's about managing the project's dependencies, whether by updating versions or replacing them.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""feature request"" is accurate for this particular issue based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the patches: ""Build MAGMA for Windows."" That suggests that someone wants to add the capability to build MAGMA on Windows, which wasn't possible before. So that sounds like a new feature or functionality being added.

Next, I see that there are two patches provided. Patch 1 seems to be modifying some batch files related to CUDA installation and setting up the environment for building. It includes installing specific versions of CUDA, setting paths, and ensuring necessary tools are in place. This is all about enabling the build process on Windows, which again points towards adding a new feature.

Patch 4 introduces a GitHub Actions workflow specifically for building MAGMA on Windows. The workflow is set up to run on Windows Server 2019, with different CUDA versions and configurations (Release and Debug). It also includes steps to upload artifacts to S3, which implies that this setup is meant to integrate seamlessly into the existing CI/CD pipeline for PyTorch. This kind of automation for building MAGMA on Windows would be a significant addition, fitting the description of a feature request.

The body of the issue includes some YAML configurations for GitHub Actions and batch scripts, which are essential for setting up the build environment. These changes are not just minor bug fixes or documentation updates; they're about adding substantial functionality to support building MAGMA on Windows, which wasn't supported before.

Additionally, the label ""feature request"" is typically used when someone is asking for a new feature or enhancement. In this case, since the issue is about adding support for building MAGMA on Windows, it fits well under that category rather than being a bug fix or other types of issues.

So putting it all together: the changes are introducing new build capabilities, integrating with CI/CD pipelines, and setting up necessary environments—all of which are characteristic of a feature request. Therefore, the label seems accurate.
</think>

The patches introduce new functionality to support building MAGMA on Windows, including CI/CD integration. This is a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33492,cache,`@Cacheable` throws `NullPointerException` when `RuntimeException` is thrown inside annotated code,"Hi, I have a piece of code in a reactive project that looks something like that (similar code for demo purposes):

```The code snippet defines a method `get` that returns a `Mono<String>` and caches the result in Redis with the key `CONSTANT`. The method always returns a `Mono` emitting the string ""result"" but throws an exception after success using `doOnSuccess`. The exception is thrown from a separate method `throwException`.```

I have a specific exception, but it basically extends from `RuntimeException`.

I've been debugging a little, and it seems that `CacheAspectSupport` had a piece of code added in commit 8974da2a that changed `ReactiveCachingHandler` from this:

```The code returns an adapter from a publisher that processes a cached future. If the future is empty, it falls back to a deferred Mono evaluated by `evaluate`. The result is then flattened using `flatMap` and re-evaluated if necessary.```

to this:

```The code returns an adapter from a publisher that handles a cached future, switches to a deferred mono if the future is empty, flattens the evaluated mono, and handles runtime exceptions by retrying evaluation or rethrowing the exception.```

The thing is, first evaluate call before the method execution sets the contexts.processed to true, and after my method throws the runtime exception, is caught by this `onErrorResume`, which calls evaluate with `cacheHit` set to `null`, and 

```This code snippet checks if the `processed` attribute of the `contexts` object is true. If it is, the function returns the value of `cacheHit`.```

returns `null`.

Is this an actual issue or I am missing something?

As of now I've done a couple of extra tests, and it seems that I cannot throw a `RuntimeException`. I have two CacheManagers configured in my Spring Boot project, one for Caffeine and the other one for Redis. This only happens when using the `RedisCacheManager` as seen above.

I think this might be because `CaffeineCache` implementation of `Cache` returns `null` when the element is not present whereas `RedisCache` implementation returns a cachedFuture.

Thanks in advance for any help provided!
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cache"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""`@Cacheable` throws `NullPointerException` when `RuntimeException` is thrown inside annotated code"". The issue is about a problem with the `@Cacheable` annotation causing an NPE under certain conditions. So this directly relates to caching functionality in Spring, as `@Cacheable` is part of the caching annotations.

Next, the body describes how the user encountered an issue when using RedisCacheManager and not Caffeine. They provided code snippets showing where the exception occurs and how it's handled, especially pointing out changes made in a specific commit. The problem arises during error handling within the caching mechanism, specifically with how `RuntimeException` is processed after a cache miss.

The patches that resolved this issue modify parts of the `findInCaches` method. They adjust how exceptions are handled by checking if an evaluated result is null and then returning an error. This seems to prevent the NPE by ensuring proper error propagation instead of potentially returning null and causing issues downstream.

Now, considering the label ""cache"". The entire issue revolves around caching behavior in Spring, specifically with `@Cacheable`, cache managers (Redis vs Caffeine), and how exceptions are handled during cache operations. The patches also directly modify code within the caching handler, which is part of the caching functionality.

I don't see any aspects of this issue that would fall outside of caching concerns. There's no mention of other Spring features like security, web, or database access. It's entirely about how exceptions are handled in a caching context, specifically with reactive types (Mono and Flux).

Additionally, the added test cases in Patch 2 further solidify that this is a cache-related issue because they test the error handling within cached services using `@Cacheable` methods.

So putting it all together, the label ""cache"" accurately captures the essence of the problem. It's about an exception occurring during caching operations and how the caching framework handles such exceptions.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43563,configuration,KafkaProperties fail to build SSL properties when the bundle name is an empty string,Forward port of issue #43561 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""KafkaProperties fail to build SSL properties when the bundle name is an empty string."" This suggests that there's a bug in how KafkaProperties handles SSL configurations when the bundle name isn't provided or is set to an empty string.

The body mentions it's a forward port of issue #43561 to 3.4.x, so this is likely a bug fix being applied to a different branch.

Now, examining the patches:

Patch 1 modifies the KafkaProperties.java file. The main changes are:
- Added an import for StringUtils.
- Refactored the buildProperties method to handle empty bundle names by checking if getBundle() returns a non-null and non-empty string using StringUtils.hasText(bundleName). If it does, it calls buildPropertiesForSslBundle; otherwise, it proceeds with setting other properties related to keyStore, trustStore, etc.
- Created a helper method buildPropertiesForSslBundle that specifically handles the case when a bundle name is provided.
- Updated the validate() method by replacing throwIfMultipleNonNullValuesIn with throwIfMultipleMatchingValuesIn and using hasValue as the predicate. This changes how mutually exclusive configurations are checked.

Patch 2 and Patch 4 seem to just update copyright years, which isn't directly relevant but indicates version updates.

Patch 3 adds a new test case: sslPemConfigurationWithEmptyBundle(). It sets various SSL properties and an empty bundle string, then checks if the consumerProperties contain the expected entries. This test ensures that when the bundle is empty, the other configurations are still correctly applied.

Putting it all together, the issue revolves around how KafkaProperties configures SSL settings when certain parameters (like the bundle name) are empty. The patches adjust the code to properly handle this scenario without errors and add tests to validate this behavior.

The label ""configuration"" fits because the problem is about how configuration properties are handled, specifically SSL configurations in KafkaProperties. The changes ensure that the configuration behaves correctly even with an empty bundle name, which directly relates to configuration handling.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[Dynamo][TVM] TVM backend not work on macOS nor Linux aarch64"". The title indicates that there's an issue with the TVM backend in PyTorch's Dynamo on both macOS and Linux aarch64 systems. So, the problem is related to the backend not functioning correctly on these platforms.

Next, the body of the issue describes the bug where using torch.compile with the TVM backend fails. The error messages on macOS mention a missing /proc/cpuinfo file, which is a Linux-specific file. On Linux aarch64, there's an error about using LLVM with the wrong target CPU. 

The repro steps show that the problem arises when trying to compile a function with the TVM backend, leading to specific errors depending on the OS. This suggests that the issue is tied to how the TVM backend determines the appropriate compiler flags or targets based on the system architecture.

Now, looking at the patches applied: they modify the `llvm_target()` function. Before, it was checking /proc/cpuinfo for AVX features and returning specific CPU targets. The patch adds a check for the platform using sys.platform == ""linux"" before accessing /proc/cpuinfo. It also adjusts the logic to handle different CPU features. On non-Linux platforms like macOS, it returns a generic ""llvm"" target.

So, the patches are adjusting how the compiler target is determined based on the system's platform and CPU architecture. This involves modifying the backend's code to correctly identify and set the appropriate LLVM targets without relying on Linux-specific files when not applicable.

The label assigned is ""compiler"". The issue revolves around the TVM backend's interaction with the compiler, specifically how it determines the correct LLVM target for different platforms. The patches fix the compiler-related logic by making it platform-aware. Therefore, the problem and solution are indeed related to the compiler or backend compilation process.

I think the label ""compiler"" fits because the issue is about the backend (TVM) not correctly setting up the compiler (LLVM) targets on certain systems. The changes made in the patches are to ensure that the correct compiler flags and targets are used based on the system's architecture, which directly relates to compilation.
</think>

The label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the issue because it deals with how the TVM backend sets LLVM targets across different platforms.

php/php-src,15661,runtime error,Access null pointer in Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c,"### Description

The following code:

```This PHP code snippet includes a `require_once` statement to include and execute the contents of the file `phar_oo_test.inc`. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, it will result in a fatal error.```

Resulted in this output:
```The log indicates an undefined behavior sanitizer error occurring at line 5043 in the file `/php-src/Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c`. Specifically, it shows that a non-zero offset of 36 was applied to a null pointer, resulting in a runtime error.```

To reproduce:
```This code snippet sets configuration directives for PHP's OpCache extension in a command-line context. It enables OpCache and JIT compilation with specific settings.```


### PHP Version

PHP 8.4.0-dev

### Operating System

ubuntu 22.04",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Access null pointer in Zend/Optimizer/zend_inference.c"". This suggests there's a problem with accessing a null pointer, which usually points to a bug or crash happening during execution. Null pointer accesses often lead to runtime errors because they cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Next, the body of the issue includes an error message: ""runtime error: applying non-zero offset 36 to null pointer"" and mentions UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer detecting undefined behavior. This explicitly states that a runtime error occurred due to accessing memory improperly, which aligns with the label ""runtime error"".

The patches provided also support this. Patch 2 modifies code in zend_inference.c, specifically changing how the next opcode is handled by checking if ssa_op is not null before using it. This prevents a potential null pointer dereference, which would cause a runtime crash.

Patch 3 adds a test case that triggers the issue and expects to output ""Done"" without errors, indicating that after the fix, the code should run without crashing—further confirming it's a runtime error scenario.

The label assigned is ""runtime error"". Since all evidence points to an issue that causes the program to crash or behave incorrectly at runtime, this label accurately reflects the problem described.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""search"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Workbench search does not use correct findMatch foreground colors."" This clearly mentions an issue related to searching in the workbench. The problem is about the color settings for search matches not being applied correctly.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It's categorized as a bug and provides steps to reproduce, which involve using the workbench sidebar search. The actual behavior shows that the text color isn't what's expected, while the expected behavior aligns with custom configurations. This further ties the issue to how search results are displayed.

The patches provided modify classes related to search matches by adding inline class names. These changes are directly aimed at fixing how search results are styled, which is part of the search functionality in VS Code.

Considering all these points—title mentions search, body describes a bug in search behavior, and patches target search result styling—it's clear that the issue revolves around the search feature. Therefore, the label ""search"" is appropriate and accurately reflects the problem described.
</think>

The label ""search"" correctly categorizes the issue as it pertains to problems with the workbench's search functionality, specifically how it displays text colors when matches are found.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""crypto/aes:gofips140: unrecognized failures [consistent failure]"". It mentions a consistent failure in the crypto/aes package related to gofips140. The word ""panic"" isn't in the title, but the issue is about some kind of failure.

Now, the body of the issue includes a panic message: ""panic: fips140: cannot verify in asan mode"". There's also a stack trace showing that the panic occurred during initialization of the check package. So clearly, a panic happened here because of an issue with FIPS verification when ASAN (AddressSanitizer) is enabled.

The patches provided are three in number. Patch 1 modifies how fipsSupported is checked by adding a condition to return false if asan is enabled. It seems they're disabling FIPS support when ASAN is on to prevent the panic. Patch 2 adds a comment about re-enabling tests elsewhere once FIPS and ASAN work together, indicating that currently they don't. Patch 3 skips a test when ASAN is enabled because it causes panics.

So all these patches are addressing the fact that running with ASAN causes a panic related to FIPS verification. The label ""panic"" was assigned, which directly relates to the error message and the root cause of the issue. The problem was that under certain conditions (ASAN enabled), the code would panic due to an incompatibility.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue because the core problem is a panic occurring during FIPS verification when ASAN is active.
</think>

The label ""panic"" correctly represents the issue as it directly addresses the panic caused by FIPS verification under ASAN.

Okay, so I'm looking at this issue where someone is trying to determine if a label assigned to an issue report in a code repository accurately reflects the content of that report. The label given is ""compiler"", and they're asking whether it's appropriate based on the provided title, body, and patches.

First, I need to understand what each part of the issue says. The issue starts with several error messages related to Rust compiler issues. These errors mention problems like lifetimes not living long enough, implementations not being general enough, and mismatched types. The patches seem to address these by adjusting how certain traits are implemented or used.

Looking at the title of the issue report isn't provided directly, but based on the context, it's probably something about Rust compiler errors related to lifetimes or trait implementations. The body includes detailed error messages from the Rust compiler, which suggests that this is a problem with how the code is being compiled or checked by the Rust compiler.

The patches made to the repository are in response to these errors. For example, one patch changes a method signature to include a specific trait bound, which helps the compiler understand that a type meets all necessary constraints across different lifetimes. Another patch adjusts the way a closure is passed to a function, ensuring it matches the expected type and lifetime requirements.

Since all these changes are directly related to how the Rust compiler interprets and checks the code, the label ""compiler"" seems appropriate. The issue revolves around errors emitted by the compiler and the fixes needed to resolve them, which falls under compiler-related issues rather than, say, runtime errors or library functionality.

I should also consider if there's any other possible label that might fit better, but given the context, ""compiler"" is spot on because it's all about the compilation process and ensuring the code meets the language's requirements.

golang/go,65237,enhancement,spec: document range-over-func,Tracking bug for adding range-over-func to spec. See #61405.,1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the issue title: ""spec: document range-over-func"". This suggests that the issue is about documenting a new feature or functionality in the specification. The term ""document"" implies adding or clarifying something in the official specs, which usually falls under documentation rather than a bug fix or enhancement.

The body of the issue is a tracking bug for adding range-over-func to the spec and references another issue #61405. Tracking bugs are often used to monitor the progress of specific features or tasks. This further indicates that it's about implementing or documenting something new, which would typically be an enhancement if it's a feature addition.

Now, examining the patches provided:

Patch 1 updates the subtitle of the specification document from go1.22 to go1.23. This seems like a version update, likely related to the release notes or documentation for a new Go version, which could be part of an enhancement release.

Patch 2 modifies the grammar section in the spec, adding details about functions as range expressions. It explains how the iteration works when using a function with yield, providing examples and usage cases. This is clearly documenting a new feature or functionality related to range-over-func.

The added content includes new cases for functions in the range expression table and detailed explanations of how the loop interacts with the yield function. These changes are about expanding the documentation to include this new feature, which suggests it's an enhancement to the language specification.

Enhancement labels are typically used for issues that propose new features or improvements to the existing codebase. Since the patches add documentation for a new range-over-func feature, this fits the definition of an enhancement.

Therefore, the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate because the issue tracks adding and documenting a new feature in the Go language specification.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33262,enhancement,Support flexible multi-unit duration format in @DurationFormat,"#30396 recently introduced support for multiple style of parsing/printing Durations, including the new SIMPLE format (`""30m""`, `""2h""`, `""530ms""`) inspired by Spring Boot.

As discussed in multiple issues ([including here](<URL> we could also support a multiple-components format such as `""1h 30m 13s""` quite similar to [one of the formats supported by Kotlin](<URL> Right now, Spring doesn't support this and instead requires developers to use the `""PT1H30M13S""` format.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Add support for Kotlin duration format (composite style)"". The word ""add"" suggests that they're introducing a new feature or functionality. That makes me think about whether this is an enhancement rather than a bug fix.

Next, I'll look into the patches provided to see what changes were made. There are four patches here. 

Patch 1 modifies DurationFormatterUtils.java by adding support for composite style parsing and printing. It includes handling of various units like days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. This indicates that they're expanding the capabilities of the existing code to handle a new format.

Patch 2 adds unit tests in DurationFormatterTests.kt. These tests check if the parser correctly interprets composite durations, handles positive and negative signs, spaces, partial durations, and edge cases like bad signs or units. Adding tests usually accompanies new features to ensure they work as intended.

Patch 3 updates another test file, adding more test cases for parsing and detecting composite styles. It also includes checks for compatibility with Kotlin's duration formatting, which suggests that this is about integrating with a new feature or improving interoperability.

Patch 4 introduces a new test class, DurationFormatterUtilsKotlinTests.kt, specifically targeting the compatibility of the formatter with Kotlin durations. This includes testing how the formatter handles strings produced by Kotlin's duration toString() method and ensuring proper parsing or failure when necessary.

Now, considering the nature of these changes: they're not fixing broken functionality but rather adding new capabilities to support a different format (Kotlin's composite style). This aligns with what an enhancement typically entails—expanding features or improving functionality without necessarily repairing bugs.

The issue report includes both feature additions and test cases to validate those additions. The fact that it's about compatibility with another language's (Kotlin) duration formatting further points towards this being an enhancement rather than a bug fix or maintenance task.

So, putting it all together: the changes are additive, introducing new supported formats and ensuring they work correctly. This is characteristic of an enhancement, which aims to improve or extend existing functionality.

Alright, I'm trying to determine if the label ""testing"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""DISABLED test_pytree (__main__.TestFX)"". It clearly mentions a disabled test named test_pytree in TestFX. So the issue is about a test being turned off, which relates to testing infrastructure.

Next, the body explains that the test was disabled because it's failing in CI. They provided links to logs and mentioned it's been flaky with 14 failures and successes over time. They also included debugging instructions for investigating further. This context suggests that the problem is specifically related to the test suite and its reliability, which falls under testing.

Looking at the patches provided, they show lines being removed from a list of tests. Specifically, ""TestFX.test_pytree"" was removed. That means the fix involved disabling this failing test in the codebase, which again points to it being a testing-related issue.

The label assigned is ""testing"". Considering all these aspects—the title mentioning a disabled test, the body discussing CI failures and flakiness, and the patch removing the problematic test—it makes sense that the issue is about testing. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue.

### What did you expect to see?

Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""cmd/go: not print not-defaults arch-env"". This suggests that there's an issue with how environment variables related to architecture are being handled by the Go command. The user is reporting that when they set GOAMD64=v3 and run the make script followed by 'go env -changed', the expected output doesn't include the setting of GOAMD64.

In the body, the user provided steps to reproduce: setting GOAMD64, running the make script, then checking the changed environment variables. They expected to see the GOAMD64 variable printed but didn't. This indicates that the 'go env -changed' command isn't showing the environment variable as it should when it's set to a non-default value.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 changes the variable names in buildcfg from lowercase (like defaultGOAMD64) to PascalCase (DefaultGOAMD64). This is a code style change but could affect how variables are referenced elsewhere.

Patch 2 modifies several environment variable assignments, replacing the use of buildcfg's fields with the new Default variables. For example, GOAMD64 now uses buildcfg.DefaultGOAMD64 instead of directly accessing buildcfg.GOAMD64. This suggests that the issue might be related to how default values are being set and compared against.

Patch 3 adds a test case where setting GOAMD64=v3 should result in 'GOAMD64=''v3'''. The expected output after running 'go env -changed' is that it prints the updated value of GOAMD64, which wasn't happening before. This patch seems to ensure that when a variable is set non-default, it's correctly reflected.

Patch 4 changes several functions (like goamd64(), goarm(), etc.) to use the new Default variables instead of the old default ones. For example, in goamd64(), it now uses envOr(""GOAMD64"", DefaultGOAMD64) instead of defaultGOAMD64. This adjustment likely ensures that when environment variables are checked against their defaults, they're using the correct values.

Putting this together, the issue was that 'go env -changed' wasn't displaying GOAMD64 when set to a non-default value because the code wasn't correctly checking against the right default variables. The patches fix this by updating variable references and ensuring proper comparisons. This is a bug because it's a malfunction in how environment variables are handled, leading to incorrect behavior.

So, yes, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue since it involves a defect in the code that was resolved with these changes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" correctly identifies an issue where the Go command didn't display non-default architecture environment variables. The patches fix how default values are handled and displayed.

And it is called ""Flawed notebook"".",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. So first, I'll look at the issue report itself.

The title says that a shared notebook gets deleted if a contributor changes its title. That sounds like unexpected behavior—when you change the name of something you shouldn't lose data or functionality. 

Looking at the body, there's a detailed scenario. Alice creates and shares a notebook with Bob. When Bob accepts it and renames it, the share button disappears for him. Then, when Alice logs back in, the notebook is gone, all notes are deleted. Also, Bob can't reshare it because of an error. That definitely seems like incorrect behavior.

Now, the expected behavior is that renaming should update the title without removing the notebook or affecting sharing. So the problem here is that the system isn’t handling the rename correctly, leading to data loss and errors. This points to a bug because it's not functioning as intended.

Next, I'll look at the patch provided. It removes two lines where `is_shared` was set to 0 and `share_id` was set to an empty string in some folder entity creation. So previously, when a folder (notebook) was being created or updated, these fields were being reset, which might have caused the share to be removed upon renaming. The patch stops that from happening, which would fix the bug.

So putting it all together: the issue describes unexpected behavior leading to data loss and errors upon renaming a shared notebook, which is clearly a bug. The patch addresses this by correcting how shared properties are handled when updating the folder. Therefore, labeling this as ""bug"" is accurate.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because it describes unintended behavior causing data loss and functionality issues, which was fixed by adjusting how shared notebook properties were managed.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v8.4.0 master
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The issue title is ""show placement always pending."" That suggests that when someone runs a ""show placement"" command, it's stuck in a pending state instead of moving forward as expected. The body of the issue includes some steps to reproduce: creating a partitioned table with a specific placement and then running the show command. 

The user expected to see ""SCHEDULED,"" which implies that they thought the system would have moved past the initial pending phase. Instead, they saw an error message indicating it was still waiting for the schedule state, with the state being ""PENDING."" They also provided their TiDB version as v8.4.0 master.

Looking at the patches, there are three changes. The first patch adds a function to set a PD HTTP client for testing, which seems related to mocking or testing the behavior of the placement scheduling. The second patch includes adding a dependency on a mock library, which is often used in unit tests to simulate external dependencies. 

The third and largest patch modifies a test file by introducing several new test cases. It creates mock implementations of PD client methods to simulate different states (PENDING, INPROGRESS, REPLICATED) and checks how the system responds when these states are set. The tests seem to ensure that ""show placement"" accurately reflects the current state of regions, whether it's for a normal table or a partitioned one.

Putting this together, the issue seems to be about incorrect behavior where the placement status doesn't transition as expected. The patches add comprehensive testing to verify these states, which suggests that previously, there might have been a bug causing ""show placement"" to incorrectly display ""PENDING."" 

So, the label ""bug"" makes sense because it's an unintended behavior that needed fixing. The patches address this by improving how the system checks and reports the actual state of placements, ensuring that ""SCHEDULED"" is shown when appropriate.
</think>

The issue describes a bug where the placement status wasn't updating correctly. Patches were made to fix this by adding tests that verify correct state transitions.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33609,bug,Potential NPE from `MethodParameter.getMethod()` check in `KotlinDelegate.hasDefaultValue()`,"## Summary
In your repository (MAVENorg.springframework:spring-web @ 6.1.12), we have found a bug that may require your attention. 

In file: AbstractNamedValueArgumentResolver.java, class: KotlinDelegate, method: hasDefaultValue, there is a potential Null pointer dereference at:  <URL>

In other places of the code (e.g., <URL> or   <URL> the return value of the ```The code snippet provided is simply `getMethod`, which appears to be a method call but lacks context such as the method signature or class name.``` method was checked for null value. But if we put it directly inside ```The code snippet is using `Objects.requireNonNull`, which is a method to throw a `NullPointerException` if the provided object reference is `null`.```, we may have an exception.

A potential fix will be to replace the following line

```This code snippet retrieves a `Method` object from a given `parameter` and ensures it is not null using `Objects.requireNonNull`. If the `method` is null, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.```

with

```This code snippet retrieves a method from a `parameter` object and checks if it is null, returning false if it is.```

Another option could be to use ```The code snippet refers to the use of `Objects.requireNonNullElse`, which is a method from the Java Util.concurrent package that returns the first non-null argument, or the second argument if the first one is null.```.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

First, looking at the title: ""Potential NPE from `MethodParameter.getMethod()` check in `KotlinDelegate.hasDefaultValue()`"". That sounds like a bug because it's pointing out a possible null pointer exception, which is a type of runtime error. So, that aligns with a bug label.

Next, the body describes a potential issue where using Objects.requireNonNull without checking for null could cause an NPE. They provided examples from other parts of the code where they do check for null before using the method, suggesting that this is a missed case and thus a bug. The suggested fix replaces the requireNonNull with a manual null check, which makes sense to prevent the exception.

Looking at the patches, both Patch 1 and Patch 2 show changes in the KotlinDelegate class. They removed the import of Objects and replaced the line where method was assigned using requireNonNull. Instead, they now get the method and check if it's null, returning false if so. This change directly addresses the potential NPE by adding a proper null check.

The issue report also mentions that this was found using an intelligent code repair tool and manual triage, which adds credibility to it being a genuine bug rather than something else like a feature request or enhancement.

So putting it all together: the title points out a potential crash (NPE), the body explains why it's a problem with code examples, and the patches fix it by adding null checks. All of these elements clearly indicate that this is a bug report. Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43018,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.2.0,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.2.0"". That immediately tells me that this issue is about upgrading a dependency, specifically Spring Batch, from some version to 5.2.0. So the title suggests it's an upgrade of a library or dependency used in the project.

Next, the body is empty. There's no additional information provided beyond the title. Since the body doesn't add any context, I have to rely on the title and patches for my assessment.

Now, looking at the patch provided:

In Patch 1, there's a change from version ""5.2.0-SNAPSHOT"" to ""5.2.0"". This indicates that the dependency was previously using a snapshot version (which is typically unstable or in development) and is now being upgraded to a stable release version of Spring Batch.

So, putting this together: The issue's title clearly states an upgrade, and the patch confirms that by changing the dependency version from a snapshot to a final release. Therefore, the action taken was indeed an upgrade of a dependency.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"", which seems to fit perfectly because the changes involve updating a library to a newer version. There's no indication that this issue involved anything else like a bug fix or new feature; it's solely about updating the version of Spring Batch used in the project.

I expected ./trace/gen.bash to copy the execution trace parser from GOROOT (which it did), to apply the code rewrites necessary to use it in its new location (did not) and without deleting the hand-maintained files in the ./trace directory (did not).

This relates to the meaning of sed's ""-i"" flag being different on GNU vs BSD.

I'll prepare a patch to make it work on both. That probably means using a non-empty backup suffix and subsequently deleting those copies. Does that sound like a good plan, @mknyszek @cagedmantis ?
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""shell"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is: ""x/exp/trace: gen.bash depends on GNU's sed, fails with BSD's"". That immediately tells me that there's a problem with the gen.bash script in the x/exp repository. The script relies on GNU sed, which works differently from BSD sed, causing it to fail on macOS, since macOS uses BSD utilities.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user explains that when they run the gen.bash script on macOS, it fails because of a sed command error. They provided the output showing an invalid command code '.' in sed, which is a common issue when GNU-specific features are used on BSD systems without proper handling.

The problem arises from the fact that the -i flag for sed behaves differently between GNU and BSD versions. In GNU sed, you can use -i with a backup suffix like -i'.tmp', but in BSD, if you want to make a backup, you have to provide a non-empty argument after -i, otherwise it's treated as an invalid command.

The patches provided show that the solution was to modify the sed commands. Instead of using -i alone, they added a '.tmp' suffix, which is compatible with both GNU and BSD. After making these changes, they also added a step to delete the temporary backup files created by sed.

Now, looking at the label assigned: ""shell"". The issue revolves around shell scripting (gen.bash) and differences in command-line utilities (sed) across different systems. Shell scripts often rely on command-line tools, so issues like this are common when ensuring cross-compatibility between Linux (which usually uses GNU tools) and macOS (BSD tools).

The patches involve changing how sed is used in the shell script to make it compatible with both GNU and BSD versions. This directly relates to shell scripting best practices and dealing with portability issues.

Therefore, the label ""shell"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue because it's about a problem in a shell script caused by using system utilities (sed) that have differing behaviors across platforms.
</think>

The label ""shell"" is appropriate as the issue concerns a problem within a shell script due to differences in sed behavior between GNU and BSD systems, which are key components of shell scripting environments.

![image](<URL>



",0,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""package management"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the details provided.

The issue title is ""npm:log4js don't work."" The body describes a problem where using log4js in Deno 1.45.5 isn't functioning as expected, providing some sample code and an output image (though I can't see the image). The key here is that the user is having trouble with the log4js package not working within their Deno setup.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. There are three patches:

1. Patch 1 modifies a TypeScript file related to cluster.ts, adding imports and changing several function implementations. It seems to be about setting up worker processes correctly.
2. Patch 2 adds a test case for cluster_test in the unit_test_factory.
3. Patch 3 introduces a new test file that checks various aspects of the node:cluster module's functionality.

These patches are primarily focused on implementing or correcting the behavior of Node.js cluster module functionalities in Deno. They're not directly about npm package management but rather about how Deno handles certain Node.js features, specifically related to clustering and worker processes.

The issue at hand is that log4js isn't working. Log4js is a logging library, so its malfunction could be due to various reasons, such as missing dependencies, incorrect imports, or issues with the environment setup in Deno. However, the patches provided don't seem to address the log4js package itself but rather the underlying cluster module implementation.

The label ""package management"" suggests that the issue is related to how packages are managed, installed, or resolved in npm. But in this case, the problem seems more about the functionality of a specific Node.js feature (cluster) within Deno and how it's being implemented or tested, not about managing packages per se.

So, putting it all together, the patches don't address package management issues but rather correct the behavior of the cluster module. Therefore, the label ""package management"" doesn't accurately reflect the nature of this issue.
</think>

The label ""package management"" does not accurately reflect the issue because the problem and its resolution pertain to implementing Node.js cluster functionality in Deno, not managing npm packages.

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue report. 

First, looking at the title: ""Web extension `broadcomMFD.hlasm-language-support` no longer works."" That sounds like something isn't functioning as expected, which typically points to a bug.

Then, the body of the issue provides detailed steps to reproduce the problem, mentions that it occurs across different versions and platforms, and includes error messages. This thorough description supports the idea that there's an unexpected behavior in the code, which aligns with a bug report.

The patches provided show changes to the Content Security Policy (CSP), specifically adding `http://localhost:*` to script-src. This suggests that the issue was due to security policies blocking necessary scripts, which is a code-level problem. Fixing this required modifying the CSP settings, indicating it's a bug fix rather than a feature request or other type of issue.

So, all parts—title, body, and patches—support that this is indeed a bug report. Therefore, the label ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as a bug because the problem described involves unexpected behavior in the codebase, requiring specific fixes to resolve it.

The current workaround is to restart the affected nodes. The refresh support was added in 8.13.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""authentication"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is about the S3 web identity token refresh failing due to a missing socket permission. That immediately tells me it's related to security or permissions, specifically around authentication tokens used with Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.

Looking at the body, the user explains that when they added support for refreshing credentials, the refresh call didn't have sufficient permissions. This caused an exception: java.security.AccessControlException related to SocketPermission. The error occurred in the context of AWS credentials and file watchers in Elasticsearch.

The patches provided include a change where the refresh method is now called with doPrivilegedVoid from SocketAccess, which suggests that they're adjusting the security privileges to allow the socket connection needed for refreshing the token. This makes sense because without the proper permissions, the application can't connect to AWS services, hence the authentication failure.

Now, considering the label assigned: ""authentication"". The issue revolves around problems with credentials and their refresh process, which is a part of authentication mechanisms. The fact that it's about web identity tokens and refreshing them points directly to how Elasticsearch authenticates with S3 using these tokens. 

I might think about other possible labels like ""security"" or ""permissions"", but since the problem is specifically about refreshing authentication credentials failing because of permission issues, ""authentication"" seems appropriate. It captures the essence of the issue—trouble with credential management and authentication processes.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the problem described in the issue.
</think>

The label ""authentication"" is appropriate as it directly relates to the issue of credential refresh failure due to insufficient permissions, which affects authentication with S3.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is ""rustdoc search: allow queries to end in ::"". The body explains that when a user searches for something like `Vec::`, it should show all associated items of `Vec`. They also mention using the label A-rustdoc-search and have some bot commands. 

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies some JavaScript code related to parsing queries in rustdoc's search functionality. It removes checks that prevent paths from ending with ""::"". So, it allows the query to end with double colons.

Patch 2 removes a test case where a query ending with ""::"" was previously causing an error. This suggests that the behavior is being changed to allow such endings.

Patch 3 adds an expected result for a query like ""Option::"", which should return specific items, indicating that the search now correctly handles trailing ""::"".

The label assigned is ""enhancement"". I need to decide if this is correct. An enhancement usually refers to a new feature or improvement rather than a bug fix.

In this case, allowing queries to end with ""::"" adds functionality to the search, making it more flexible and user-friendly. It's not fixing a bug but improving how the tool works, which fits the definition of an enhancement.

So yes, the label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects this issue.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42002,forward port,Maven plugin integration tests cannot run against release local repository,Forward port of issue #42001 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Maven plugin integration tests cannot run against release local repository."" This suggests that there was a problem with Maven plugin tests not running correctly when using a local release repository. The body mentions it's a forward port of issue #42001 to the 3.4.x branch, which indicates they're taking a fix from another version and applying it here.

Now, examining the patches provided: Patch 1 shows additions to the build.gradle file. Specifically, two new mavenRepository entries are added. One points to spring-boot-dependencies and the other to spring-boot-starter-parent. These changes seem aimed at correctly resolving dependencies during testing, which would address why the tests couldn't run before.

The term ""forward port"" in software development usually refers to taking a bug fix from an older version (or a different branch) and applying it to a newer version or another branch. In this case, since they're forwarding issue #42001 to 3.4.x, that fits the definition of a forward port.

So, putting it all together: The issue was about a problem in Maven integration tests, which required adding more dependency repositories. This fix was taken from a previous issue and applied here. Therefore, labeling it as ""forward port"" is accurate because they're bringing an existing fix into another branch to resolve the same issue there.

I don't see any conflicting information. The patches align with the problem described, and the label correctly describes the action of moving a fix from one place to another.

### Is this a regression?

No

### Description

When defining a variable inside of a template (for example setting a variable with $index in a loop), using `this.` in combination with that variable will resolve to the local template variable and not the component variable.

`````This TypeScript code snippet defines an Angular component with a standalone decorator. It uses a template syntax to iterate over `list` and display each item along with an index. The index is intended to be displayed as `idx`, but the template logic sets it to `$index` instead. The `list` contains a single item ""hello"", and there is a mismatch in the index variable name between the component property and the template.```

This shows `0 hello` instead of `this should be idx hello`.

### Anything else?

We noticed this by accident, obviously not a show-stopper, we just have a co-worker who's convinced he should use the `this` keyword in templates and doesn't want to stop.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""template"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The issue's title is: ""Using this keyword in templates will use template variables instead of component variables."" This suggests that when using `this` in a template, it refers to template variables rather than component ones, which might not be the intended behavior.

Looking at the body, the user provided an example where `{{ this.idx }}` inside a loop uses the local index variable from the template instead of the component's property. They also included code snippets and a stackblitz link for reproduction, which indicates it's a bug report regarding how `this` behaves in templates.

Now, examining the patches made to resolve the issue:

1. **Patch 1** modifies the condition in `TcbExpressionTranslator` to exclude `ThisReceiver`, preventing `this` from referring to template variables.
2. **Patches 2-5 and 8** adjust templates to remove `this.` usage, which suggests that the problem lies within how the template compiler interprets `this`.
3. **Patch 6** changes conditions in `convertAst` to only convert implicit receivers, avoiding explicit `this` reads.
4. **Patches 7** adds tests ensuring that `this.value` doesn't resolve to template variables.

All these patches focus on the behavior of `this` within templates and how the compiler resolves variable references. The issue is about how Angular's templating system handles scope when using `this`, specifically in contexts where both component and template variables exist.

The label ""template"" seems appropriate because the problem is directly related to Angular's template engine and how it processes expressions, especially those involving `this`. The bug and its fixes are centered around the templating system, not other areas like routing or forms.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to the behavior within templates.

gohugoio/hugo,12805,rendering,Extend blockquote alerts to support Obsidian AlertTitle,"In addition to custom alert typo (see #12801) it would also be nice to support [Obsidian's callout titles](<URL> too. At least enough for me to use a blockquote render hook to support it. As is, if this markdown is sent to the render hook:

```The code snippet is a markdown format note indicating that alerts are an effective way to highlight information for the reader.```

The the text ""Alerts are awesome"" (the ""title"") is not passed to the render hook at all; it just vanishes. It would be great if the render hook got `.AlertTitle` or something so I could implement an alert with a title myself, even if the default was to do nothing with it (current behavior).

However, the following illustrates how GitHub handles things.

----

> [!NOTE] Title Test
> Title Test 1: I have a title

> [!NOTE]
> Title Test 2: I have no title

----

As you can see, GitHub doesn't even render the blockquote as an alert if there's a title. So maybe Hugo's current behavior should be considered a bug (feel free to change the tag to ""bug"" if you agree). If a title is present then Hugo shouldn't consider the blockquote to be an alert at all; `.AlertType` should be empty and `.Text` should contain the entire contents of the blockquote. Fixing this would allow me to parse the title myself if I want to.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""rendering"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches.

First, let's look at the issue's title: ""Extend blockquote alerts to support Obsidian AlertTitle."" This suggests that the problem is about enhancing how blockquotes are rendered when they include titles in the Obsidian format. The title directly mentions rendering aspects related to alerts and their titles.

Next, the body of the issue explains that currently, when using Obsidian-style callouts with titles, the title isn't passed to the render hook, causing it to vanish. The user wants the render hook to receive this information so they can implement custom rendering. They also mention that GitHub doesn't render blockquotes as alerts if a title is present, implying that there's an issue with how these are being processed.

Looking at the patches provided:

1. Patch 1 adds documentation for new fields AlertTitle and AlertSign in the context passed to the render hook. This indicates that the code now includes these new properties, allowing them to be accessed during rendering.
2. Patch 2 modifies the BlockquoteContext interface to include methods for AlertTitle() and AlertSign(). These are new additions that directly relate to how alerts are rendered with their titles and signs.
3. Patch 3 changes the way alerts are resolved. It introduces a struct blockQuoteAlert which includes typ, sign, and title fields. This means the rendering logic now parses and handles these additional attributes extracted from the markdown.
4. Patch 4 adds tests that check if the new fields (AlertType, AlertTitle, AlertSign) are correctly passed to the render hook. The tests cover various scenarios with titles and signs, ensuring proper rendering behavior.
5. Patch 5 updates a test function to use the new blockQuoteAlert struct, ensuring that different inputs (including those with titles and signs) are correctly parsed.

All these patches focus on enhancing how blockquote alerts are processed and rendered, particularly extending support for Obsidian's callout features like titles and foldable signs. The changes involve modifying context variables, parsing logic, and tests to ensure that the rendering accurately reflects these new attributes.

Given this analysis, the issue is indeed about improving the rendering of blockquotes with specific attention to handling new alert title and sign syntax from Obsidian. Therefore, the label ""rendering"" is appropriate as it directly relates to how content is displayed in the application.

```The code snippet initializes a `MyVector` with five undefined elements and attempts to append a value of `1` using `push!`. It results in a `MethodError` because `MyVector` does not have a `resize!` method implemented, which is required for appending elements.```

After implmenting `resize!` as follows,

```This code snippet defines a method `resize!` for a type `MyVector` in Julia. It resizes the underlying vector `v` of type `MyVector` to the specified size `nl`.```

this allows `push!` to work on Julia 1.10.

```The code snippet initializes a `MyVector` with 5 undefined elements and then demonstrates using `push!` to add an element to the vector and `append!` to add multiple elements, resulting in a `MyVector` with 9 elements.```

On Julia 1.11-rc2, this no longer works:
`````The code snippet demonstrates creating a `MyVector` object with 5 elements and then attempting to add an element to it using `push!`. The attempt fails due to a `MethodError`, indicating that there is no method defined for `sizehint!` for `MyVector` with an integer argument. This error suggests that `MyVector` does not have the necessary implementation for methods like `push!` or `sizehint!`.```

Following the suggestion, an implementation of `sizehint!` leads to StackOverflow error on Julia 1.11:

```The code snippet defines a method `sizehint!` for a custom vector type `MyVector` that delegates to the base implementation. However, using this method leads to a `StackOverflowError` when calling `push!` or `append!` on an instance of `MyVector`. The error occurs because the `sizehint!` method is called recursively, causing an infinite loop and exhausting the stack.```

As of #51903, `append!(a::AbstractVector, iter)` depends on `push!(a::AbstractVector, iter...)`. This is problematic because `push!(a::AbstractVector, iter...)` depends on `append!(a::AbstractVector, iter)` which leads to the above stack overflow condition.

<URL>

The new implementation of `append!` suggests that we should modify the generic implementation of `push!` for `AbstractVector`:

```This Julia code snippet defines a custom implementation of the `push!` function for `AbstractVector` types. It first checks if the input is an `AbstractVector`, and if so, it increases the vector's length by one, resizes the vector to accommodate the new element, adds the specified value `v` at the new end position, and returns the modified vector. Additionally, it overloads `push!` to accept multiple arguments (iterable elements) and appends them to the vector using `append!`.```

Importantly, this new implementation of `push!` now only depends on the `AbstractArray` interface and an implementation of `resize!`.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""compatibility"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""push!, append! AbstractVector implementations no longer work on Julia 1.11+"". This immediately tells me that something stopped working when moving from Julia 1.10 to 1.11, which suggests a compatibility issue because functionality broke with an update.

The body of the issue describes how custom AbstractVector implementations were working correctly up to Julia 1.10 by implementing `resize!`, but on 1.11, using `push!` or `append!` causes errors. The user tried adding `sizehint!` but ended up with a stack overflow instead. They reference another GitHub issue (#51903) and changes in the implementation of `append!` that now depend on `push!`, leading to circular dependencies.

The patches provided show modifications to the base array functions, particularly introducing new generic versions of `push!` for AbstractVectors, including type conversions and handling multiple items. There's also a test added to ensure that `push!` works correctly with various arguments across different array types.

Now, considering the label ""compatibility"": This term generally refers to ensuring that code works across different versions or environments without issues. In this case, the problem arises because of changes in Julia 1.11 that broke existing functionality which worked before. The patches aim to restore compatibility by adjusting how `push!` and related functions work for AbstractVectors.

The issue is about adapting code to maintain functionality across version updates, which fits well under compatibility. The fixes aren't introducing new features but ensuring that existing code works as intended after changes in the language or standard libraries.

So yes, the label ""compatibility"" accurately reflects this problem because it's about maintaining functionality across different versions of Julia.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42267,forward port,Fix deprecation warning caused by the testResultsOverview build service being used without a corresponding declaration,Forward port of issue #42266 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Fix deprecation warning caused by the testResultsOverview build service being used without a corresponding declaration."" This seems like it's addressing a specific problem where a certain service isn't declared properly, leading to a deprecation warning. The fix is about resolving that warning.

Next, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #42266 to 3.4.x."" Hmm, this clearly mentions that this issue is a forward port of another issue. So the main purpose here is taking changes from one branch (probably a newer or different version) and applying them to the 3.4.x branch.

Now looking at the patches provided. The first patch updates the copyright year from 2023 to 2024, which seems minor but necessary for versioning. The second part of the patch modifies how a test listener is added. Instead of directly adding the listener, it now uses `test.usesService(testResultsOverview);` before adding the listener. This change likely ensures that the service is properly declared before use, which would fix the deprecation warning mentioned in the title.

Putting this together: The issue is about fixing a deprecation warning by correctly declaring a service. However, the body explicitly states it's a forward port from another issue. The patches made are indeed applying changes to resolve the issue, but they're part of a forward port process. So the label ""forward port"" makes sense here because the primary action was taking existing changes and moving them to another branch or version line (3.4.x).

Wait, but does the label capture both the purpose of the issue and the nature of the fix? The issue's title is about fixing a problem, while the body clarifies it's a forward port. So the label ""forward port"" is more about how the fix was implemented (by porting existing changes) rather than what the fix achieves.

But in GitHub issues, labels often indicate the type or category of the issue. If this issue exists solely to move changes from one branch to another, then labeling it as a forward port makes sense. The patches themselves are part of that process, even though they address a specific bug.

So I think the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects that this issue is about taking existing work (from #42266) and applying it to the 3.4.x branch. Therefore, yes, the label fits.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue as described in both the body and the patches applied. The issue's purpose was to forward port changes from another issue to a different version branch.

microsoft/vscode,211374,bug,Dataloss when renaming file two times,"Hello everyone.

Microsoft has a lot of text editor on their different products and I have come to a way of working (which might not be the best of all in some cases) and it seems like using Visual Studio Code in a manner allows the customer, like myself, to be loosing its file progress when renaming a file. 

This happened after I wanted to rename a java class, for example, “myclass.java” to “MyClass.java”.
Since the change lookup is case insensitive, they both are of equal names which will result in no name change, so you will have to rename the file to a temporary name in order to make your change.

Now the following process will come in to the bug to be fixed.

- Create a new file name “myclass.java”.
- Enter the following code into that file (replace the content if necessary):

```This code snippet defines a public class named `myclass` with a default public constructor.```

- Now save the file.
- Now add this method to the class:
```The code snippet defines a method named `myMethod` that is currently empty and marked as ""My work in progress..."".```

- Now without saving this time. Rename the file using the right-click in the object-browser pane of the VSCode to “temporaryname.java”. You will see the file has the same content but with the new name.
- Now rename the file again like before to “MyClass.java”. Now, it will be taking the last saved file named “myclass.java” and take its content instead of taking the current file content. Therefore loosing all work in progress. In this case, the class myclass will no longer have the method myMethod(), and there will be an error from the intellisense since the class myclass does not equal MyClass.

Now I know that saving will fix all of this. BUT, Microsoft, as a reliable source for text editing, at least I would have liked a minimum of a prompt of “Are you sure you want to rename the file to ""newNameFile""? The work in progress might be loss.”

This is very common for I to do this in other Microsoft text editing products and this seems to be a bug to be fixed. Allowing the customer to loose its progress without warning is a bug to me.

All thanks.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""Dataloss when renaming file two times."" This suggests that there's an issue where data is lost during a specific operation, which sounds like unintended behavior—commonly referred to as a bug.

Next, reading the body of the issue. The user describes a scenario where they rename a file twice in VSCode, leading to loss of unsaved work. They explain the steps clearly and mention that without saving after each change, renaming causes data loss. They also suggest that a warning prompt would be helpful, implying this is unexpected behavior.

The patches provided are two code snippets from different files. Both seem to modify how file operations are handled, specifically using canonical URIs to prevent stale states. The comments explicitly reference the issue number and mention fixing a potential data loss problem. This indicates that the developers acknowledged it as an issue requiring a fix.

Considering all these points—the title indicating data loss, the detailed description of unexpected behavior, and patches addressing the problem—it's clear that this is a bug report. Therefore, the label ""bug"" is appropriate.

rust-lang/rust,119697,unsoundness,let_underscore_drop hallunicates variable binding,"### Code

`````The code snippet defines a Rust struct `Foo` with a `String` field, and a type alias `Tait` that implements `Sized`. It includes a function `ice_cold` that takes a value of type `Tait`, destructures it into a `Foo` instance, and then attempts to drop the `field` string, which triggers a compilation warning due to unused variable `_ = field`. The `main` function is empty.```


### Current output

`````````The log shows two warnings related to the `let_underscore_drop` lint in Rust:

1. A non-binding `let` statement is being dropped immediately.
2. The lint level for this warning is set in the file.

These warnings suggest that variables declared with `_` are being dropped without being bound to another variable, which can lead to unnecessary resource cleanup.```


### Desired output

```````The log indicates that the code suggests using `_unused = filed` because `_unused` is not in scope, but it implies that `_unused` is intended to be used as a placeholder for `filed`.```


### Rationale and extra context

Otherwise it will fail to cargo-fix:
`````````The code snippet shows an error message indicating that Rust cannot find a value named `_unused` in the current scope on line 15.

### Anything else?

_No response_",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""unsoundness"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is ""let_underscore_drop hallunicates variable binding."" Hmm, that seems a bit technical. From the body, it looks like there's some Rust code provided with certain warnings and desired outputs.

Looking at the code example in the body, they're using a lint called let_underscore_drop. The warning says something about a non-binding let on a type that implements Drop. So, I think this is related to how variables are bound or dropped in Rust.

The user wants the suggestion when this lint triggers to propose binding to an unused variable instead of just using `_ = field;`. They mention that previously, suggesting `_unused = field` without introducing `let` causes a compile error because `_unused` isn't declared. So the fix involves adding `let _unused = field;`.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are several patches, but they seem to modify how the lint behaves and what suggestions it gives. For example, Patch 3 changes the suggestion to include ""let"" if it's an assign desugar situation. Other patches add test cases where the lint should trigger and check that the correct suggestions are made.

The key here is whether the label ""unsoundness"" fits this issue. Unsoundness in programming languages refers to a situation where a program can violate the type system, leading to incorrect behavior without runtime errors. But in this case, the issue is about linter warnings related to variable binding and dropping values.

This doesn't seem to involve any unsoundness because it's not about bypassing type safety or causing undefined behavior. Instead, it's more about code style, best practices for avoiding unnecessary drops, and improving the user experience with better error messages.

So, the label ""unsoundness"" might be incorrect here. The problem is more about usability of the lint system rather than any soundness issues in the language itself.
</think>

The issue revolves around a Rust linter warning related to variable binding and dropping values, aiming to improve code suggestions without affecting type safety. It doesn't involve unsoundness.

golang/go,69526,bug,text/template: incorrect error line number reporting after multiline comments,"### Go version

go version go1.23.0 darwin/amd64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```This code snippet appears to be a collection of environment variables related to the Go programming language setup on a macOS system with ARM64 architecture. It includes details such as the Go version, paths to various directories and tools, compiler flags, and other configuration settings.```


### What did you do?

I encountered a problem with incorrect error line number reporting when using the `text/template` package. Specifically, if a template has a multiline comment (e.g., `{{/* ... */}}`), and an error occurs (such as an undefined function) on a line immediately after the comment, the reported error line is incorrect and points to the start of the comment block or earlier.

Example code [<URL>
`````The code initializes a Go template from a multiline comment and an undefined function call, then attempts to parse and execute the template, logging errors if they occur.```

### What did you see happen?

The error reported the wrong line number):

`Template parse error: template: test:2: function ""undefinedFunction"" not defined`

### What did you expect to see?

I expected the error to report the correct line where the undefined function is used:

`Template parse error: template: test:5: function ""undefinedFunction"" not defined",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" correctly reflects the issue reported in the GitHub issue. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""text/template: incorrect error line number reporting after multiline comments."" This suggests there's a problem with how line numbers are reported when errors occur near multiline comments in templates. That definitely sounds like a bug because it's about incorrect behavior in the code.

Next, I read through the body of the issue. The user explains that when using the text/template package, if an error occurs right after a multiline comment, the error message points to the wrong line number. They provided example code and demonstrated that the error reports line 2 instead of the correct line 5 where the undefined function is called. This indicates unexpected behavior in the software, which aligns with what a bug is.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved the issue. Patch 1 modifies the lexer to correctly count lines within comments by adding the number of newlines in the comment content. This ensures that after a multiline comment, the line numbers for subsequent errors are accurate. Patch 2 updates the test cases to include scenarios with long comments followed by undefined functions, which helps verify that the bug is fixed.

The label ""bug"" is assigned because it accurately describes an issue where the system doesn't behave as intended. The error reporting was incorrect, and the patches fix this behavior, so labeling it as a bug makes sense.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because the problem involves incorrect line number reporting in error messages, which is unexpected behavior fixed by specific code changes.

denoland/deno,26508,formatting,Deno panicked formatting a HTML file,"Version: Deno 2.0.2

I have the following file:

`````````This HTML code snippet creates a web page that displays a bar chart and detailed data. It includes:

- Basic HTML structure with a title set dynamically.
- CSS for styling, including a responsive body layout and grid display for data list items.
- JavaScript to fetch and process JSON data from `./monthly-visits.json`, then:
  - Create a bar chart using the `frappe.Chart` library.
  - Update the document title.
  - Dynamically generate and insert HTML content into the `#details` div to display dataset names and corresponding formatted numerical values.```

It looks like the cause is this piece of code inside the `<script>` tag:

`````````The code snippet sets the `innerHTML` of an element with the ID `details` to dynamically generate HTML content based on `datasets`. It iterates over each dataset, creating an `<h2>` for the name and a `<dl>` list for the label-value pairs, formatted using `fmt`.```

If I remove this part, it works fine.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""formatting"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue title is ""Deno panicked formatting a HTML file."" That immediately suggests that Deno crashed when trying to format an HTML file. The body describes how running `deno fmt viewer.html` caused a panic, and the user provided the HTML code and the error output.

Looking at the body, the user mentions that the problem seems to be with a specific part of the JavaScript code inside the `<script>` tag. They even tested by removing that part and it worked fine. So, the issue is related to how Deno's formatter handles certain JavaScript code within HTML files.

Now, checking the patches applied to fix this issue. There are three patches:

1. Updates a plugin from version 0.93.0 to 0.93.1.
2. Upgrades ""markup_fmt"" from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0 and updates its checksum.
3. Similarly, another patch upgrades ""markup_fmt"" in the workspace dependencies.

The ""markup_fmt"" crate is related to formatting markup languages like HTML. Updating it suggests that the bug was in how Deno formats HTML files, possibly when they contain embedded JavaScript.

So, putting it all together: The issue arises during the formatting of an HTML file because of specific JavaScript code. The patches address the formatter's handling of such cases by updating relevant dependencies. Therefore, the label ""formatting"" is spot on because the problem is directly tied to Deno's formatting functionality.

I don't see any other aspects here like performance or security; it's clearly about formatting not working correctly and causing a panic.
</think>

The issue revolves around Deno's formatter crashing when processing an HTML file with specific JavaScript code. The patches target the formatter's dependencies, confirming that the problem lies within the formatting functionality.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33565,filter,UrlHandlerFilter should not strip the trailing slash from the contextPath URL,"Although <URL> has been fixed for root URLs, it looks like there is still a problem with the `UrlHandlerFilter` when `server.servlet.contextPath` is specified.

Here is a minimal application to reproduce it: <URL>

```This line sets the context path for a Spring Boot application server to `/myApp`.```
And use the following `UrlHandlerFilter`:
```This code snippet creates an instance of `UrlHandlerFilter` configured to add a trailing slash for URLs matching `/**` and wraps the request before building the filter.```

And in this case, both `<URL> and `<URL> work fine, however,
`<URL> and `<URL> don't and return  404. 

Controller for the root looks like this:

```This Java code defines a REST controller with a single endpoint that responds to GET requests at the root path and ""/greeting"" with the string ""Hello world!"".```
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""filter"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem.

The issue title says that UrlHandlerFilter should not strip the trailing slash from the contextPath URL. So it's about the behavior of the UrlHandlerFilter in Spring Framework when a context path is set.

Looking at the body, the user explains that even though a previous issue (33444) was fixed for root URLs, there's still an issue when server.servlet.contextPath is specified. They provided a minimal test project and code examples showing how the problem occurs with URLs like /myApp and /myApp/ returning 404 errors.

The patches made to resolve this are in four parts. Patch 1 modifies the canHandle method in AbstractTrailingSlashHandler, changing path.elements() to path.pathWithinApplication().elements(). Similarly, Patches 2, 3, and 4 adjust how paths are handled by considering the contextPath when building requests or handling exchanges.

These patches all relate to how UrlHandlerFilter processes URLs, especially regarding trailing slashes and context paths. The label ""filter"" seems relevant because it directly relates to the functionality of UrlHandlerFilter, which is a filter in Spring Framework that handles URL manipulations.

The issue revolves around the filter's behavior with context paths and trailing slashes. All patches are within classes related to the filter and its handling methods. So, using the label ""filter"" accurately categorizes this problem as it's about how the UrlHandlerFilter is processing URLs.

Therefore, the label ""filter"" does reflect the issue accurately.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Json breaks for large files after roughly 50000 lines."" This suggests that when handling JSON files with a large number of lines (around 50k), something goes wrong. The word ""breaks"" implies that there's an issue or malfunction in the software, which is typically classified as a bug.

Next, the body of the issue. The user provided details about their environment—VS Code version, OS, and other specifics. They mentioned that when loading a JSON file with more than 52632 lines and scrolling past line 52632, something fails. They also included steps to reproduce and images (though I can't see them, but they likely show the problem visually). The fact that they provided detailed reproduction steps further supports this being a bug report since users usually do this when encountering unexpected behavior.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve the issue. There are several code changes across different files. Each patch introduces a new variable called `bigNumbersDelta` and adjusts various calculations by subtracting this delta. The comments mention handling large numbers to prevent issues, specifically noting that IE can't handle very large pixel values, so they reduce the numbers every 500k pixels.

These patches indicate that the problem was related to how vertical offsets were calculated when dealing with large files, leading to incorrect rendering or performance issues. By adjusting these calculations and introducing `bigNumbersDelta`, the developers mitigated the bug where the JSON parser or renderer would break for large files.

Considering all this, the issue is clearly about unexpected behavior in the software (VS Code) when handling large JSON files, which fits the definition of a bug. The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem described and the fixes applied.
</think>

The issue report describes a malfunction in VS Code when handling large JSON files, supported by detailed steps and patches fixing rendering issues. Thus, the label is accurate.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""concurrency"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at the title of the issue: ""[CI] SearchTemplateRequestTests testConcurrentSerialization failing"". The word ""testConcurrentSerialization"" stands out here. That suggests that the problem is related to concurrent serialization, which typically involves multiple threads accessing shared resources and how they handle serialization.

Looking at the body of the issue, it provides details about build scans and a reproduction line. It mentions that this test is failing with an AssertionError where both expected and actual values are the same, but that's a bit confusing. Maybe there's some race condition causing inconsistent results sometimes.

The failure message shows an assertion error between two ""unset"" values. That might indicate that under concurrent access, some variables aren't being set as expected or are being overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue: 

In Patch 1, several test methods related to SearchTemplateRequestTests and RankEvalRequestTests were removed or modified. The tests include names like ""testConcurrentSerialization"" and similar concurrency-related terms. This suggests that the failures were occurring in these specific test cases which are designed to check concurrent behavior.

Patch 2 modifies code in a way that seems to handle options related to allowSelectors, accessing gatekeeperOptions directly instead of through another method. The comments mention a feature flag being removed, which might be part of a larger change related to concurrency control or how certain features are gated.

Putting it all together: the test failures are specifically in methods testing concurrent serialization and related areas. The patches address these tests and parts of the code that manage concurrency-related flags or options. Therefore, the issue is indeed about concurrency problems in the tests, which would make the label ""concurrency"" accurate.

```The log indicates an `AuthenticationException` with the message ""error token"" occurred in a Spring application's dispatcher servlet. The root cause of the exception is an `ArrayStoreException`, which was triggered when attempting to store an `Integer` in a collection that expects a different type. This issue arises from the `toArray` method being called on an `AbstractCollection`, likely due to mismatched types in the underlying data structure.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the title, body, and the patches provided.

The title of the issue is ""Ignore non-String keys in `PropertiesPropertySource.getPropertyNames()`"". From that, it seems like the problem has something to do with handling properties where the keys aren't strings. The method in question is getPropertyNames(), which probably retrieves all the property names from a source. So the issue arises when there are keys that aren't Strings, causing some kind of error.

Looking at the body, there's an example code snippet: System.getProperties().put(1,1); which adds an Integer key to the system properties. Then there's a stack trace showing an ArrayStoreException with java.lang.Integer. The exception occurs in org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationException, but digging deeper, it seems related to how Spring's PropertiesPropertySource handles property names.

The error happens when trying to convert a collection to an array, specifically at StringUtils.toStringArray(). It looks like the code was expecting all keys to be Strings, but since there are non-String keys (like Integer 1), it throws this exception because you can't put an Integer into a String array.

Now looking at the patches. The first patch modifies the getPropertyNames() method in PropertiesPropertySource.java. Instead of just calling super.getPropertyNames(), which probably returns all keys including non-Strings, they're now filtering the keySet() to include only String instances and then converting that to a String array. This should prevent any non-String keys from causing issues.

The second patch is a test case in MapPropertySourceTests.java. They create a set of expected keys using System.getProperties().stringPropertyNames(), which only includes String keys, but they add STRING_PROPERTY_NAME manually because it might have a non-String value and was filtered out. Then they assert that the property names from the source match this expected set.

So putting it all together: The issue is about handling configuration properties where some keys aren't Strings, causing runtime exceptions. The fix ensures only String keys are considered in getPropertyNames(), which affects how configurations are loaded and processed.

The label assigned was ""configuration"". Considering that, the problem revolves around system properties and how they're handled by Spring's environment and configuration classes. Configuration issues often relate to how properties are read, stored, and accessed, so this seems relevant.

But wait, is there another possible label like ""bug"" or ""error-handling""? The issue does describe a bug causing an exception, but the fix is specifically about filtering keys in configuration handling. So while it's technically a bug, the main theme is configuration processing.

The issue revolves around handling non-String keys in property sources, affecting configuration processing. The patches ensure only String keys are considered, fitting under the configuration category.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""lifetime"" accurately reflects the issue report based on its title, body, and patches. Let's start by understanding what each part is about.

The issue report has a title related to type placeholders in item signatures, specifically in Rust. The main problem seems to be that using underscores as placeholders in types within function signatures or other item declarations isn't allowed anymore. 

Looking at the body of the report and the patches, it's clear that several errors are being addressed where `_` is used in various contexts like functions, structs, type aliases, etc. For example, one error message mentions replacing `_` with proper type parameters to fix issues in function signatures.

The patches show changes across multiple files, all related to correcting these placeholder usages. They adjust implementations and item signatures to use generic types instead of underscores. This is about improving the strictness of Rust's type system, preventing the misuse of placeholders where they shouldn't be allowed.

Now, considering the label ""lifetime"": lifetimes in Rust are about managing references' scopes. The issue here isn't directly related to how lifetimes are handled but rather to type placeholder usage. So the changes and errors don't pertain to lifetime management but to general type system enforcement.

Therefore, the label ""lifetime"" doesn't accurately reflect this issue report.

NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra,6782,bug,Tabs in modals fail to focus,"**Describe the bug**
This is an intermittent bug, but I will do my best to explain it. Basically, in several places where there is a TabView (or whatever it is called), it seems Ghidra is unable to focus specific tabs (see reproduction steps for more information).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Perform a search or open a struct in the Structure Editor (both are modals with tabs)
2. Perform another search or open another struct (should add a tab to the modal and focus it)
3. Observe the modal opening, but the new tab not focusing

**Expected behavior**
The search results and/or Structure Editor opens and the newly opened tab is focused

**Screenshots**

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: macOS 14.6
 - Java Version: 22.0.1
 - Ghidra Version: 11.1.2
 - Ghidra Origin: GitHub releases

**Additional context**
This is intermittent, but I have noticed it enough to where it is frustrating. This was not happening on the version I used previously: 11.0.3.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The issue title is ""Tabs in modals fail to focus."" That clearly points to a problem where tabs aren't getting focus as expected when using modals. The body of the issue describes it as an intermittent bug, which suggests it doesn't happen every time but occurs frequently enough to be frustrating. It provides reproduction steps involving opening searches or structs in the Structure Editor, leading to modals with tabs that should focus on newly opened ones but don't.

The expected behavior is that the new tab gets focused when opened. The environment details include macOS 14.6, Java Version 22.0.1, and Ghidra version 11.1.2 from GitHub releases. This setup helps in identifying potential platform or software-specific issues. Additionally, the user mentions it wasn't a problem in version 11.0.3, indicating this might be a regression.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies code related to `focusComponent` method. It checks for a non-null placeholder and calls `requestFocusWhenReady()` instead of using `Swing.runLater()`. This suggests a change in how focus is requested, possibly addressing timing issues where the component wasn't ready.

Patch 2 renames `requestFocus()` to `requestFocusWhenReady()` and introduces an `ExpiringSwingTimer` to wait before requesting focus. It also includes a method `doRequestFocus` that uses `KeyboardFocusManager` to ensure the window is active before focusing, which seems like it's adding safeguards against focusing when the application isn't ready.

Patch 3 updates the `updateFocus` method to call `requestFocusWhenReady()` directly without using `Swing.runLater()`, aligning with the changes in Patches 1 and 2. It removes redundant checks that were previously done within a Swing-run later block, which might have been causing race conditions.

Patch 4 modifies the `add` method to use `info.requestFocusWhenReady()` instead of `requestFocus()`. This ensures consistency across the codebase in how focus is handled after adding components.

All these patches are aimed at addressing issues where tabs aren't focusing as expected. They seem to refactor how focus is requested, particularly by using a delayed approach to ensure that components are ready and the application is in the correct state before attempting to set focus. This should prevent intermittent failures due to timing issues or unready UI states.

Considering all this, the issue report describes a malfunction in the software (tabs not focusing) which is a bug. The patches provided directly target fixing this behavior by adjusting how focus is managed. Therefore, labeling it as ""bug"" is accurate because it's an unintended defect that causes the software to behave incorrectly.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""failure"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the issue title: ""[CI] AzureSnapshotRepoTestKitIT class failing"". That clearly indicates a problem with a test class in CI, which relates to test failures. So that's a point towards the label being appropriate.

The body of the issue lists multiple build scans and failure history. It mentions 4 consecutive failures in the specific test class, high fail rates in certain steps, and provides a dashboard link for more details on the failures. This all points to recurring issues causing test failures, which aligns with the ""failure"" label.

Now looking at the patches. Several of them are modifying tasks to disable certain tests when in FIPS mode because they can't override the trust store there. For example, Patch 1 and Patch 9 add conditions to disable managedIdentityYamlRestTest and workloadIdentityJavaRestTest when BuildParams.inFipsJvm is true. Similarly, other patches adjust system properties or conditions based on whether it's FIPS mode. The TODO comments in Patches 2,5,6,7,8,10 mention that the HTTPS fixture should be used once a specific issue is addressed, indicating that currently, these tests are skipped in FIPS to prevent failures.

These changes suggest that the failing tests were causing CI issues, and the solution was to disable them under certain conditions. This directly relates to test failures, which the ""failure"" label represents.

There's no indication that this is a bug or an enhancement request; it's clearly about resolving test failures in the CI pipeline. So all the evidence supports that the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to recurring test failures in the CI environment, supported by both the issue description and the patches applied.

FuelLabs/sway,6337,panic,Sway compiler crash for access out-of-bound memory in intrinsic function arguments check during semantic analysis,"From <URL>

# Brief/Intro
Sway compiler crash for access out-of-bound memory during arguments check in semantic analysis.

# Vulnerability Details
In type_check_encode_append function of the semantic_analysis/ast_node/expression/intrinsic_function.rs#L239, there's no length check for argument in [1]. When the intrinsic function is defined with improper argument parameters, out-of-bound access happens in [1].
```The code snippet defines a function `type_check_encode_append` that performs type checking and encoding for a specific intrinsic function. It initializes a buffer type, type-checks an expression with this buffer type, and extracts the span of another argument. The function returns a result containing either a tuple of intrinsic function kind and type ID, or an error.```
This leads to the out-of-bound vector access
# Impact Details
Online verification service or sway playground which accept sw contract could be crashed by the malicous sw contract.

# References
[1] <URL>

# Proof of Concept
Compile the following contract using forc build:
```The code snippet defines a library with a struct `Buffer` and a trait `T`. It also provides an implementation of `T` for a fixed-size string slice `str[10]`, which includes a method `a` that returns a new `Buffer` with an encoded buffer value.```
Running it would get the following panic:
`````The log indicates that during compilation, the program encountered a panic in the `intrinsic_function.rs` file at line 239. Specifically, there was an attempt to access an index out of bounds in a list or array with a length of 1, using an index of 1. This resulted in a runtime error.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the title of the issue is about a crash in the Sway compiler due to accessing out-of-bound memory during semantic analysis. The body explains that there's no length check for arguments in a specific function, leading to an index out of bounds error. They provided a proof of concept where compiling certain code causes a panic with an error message about the index being out of bounds.

Looking at the patches, Patch 1 adds a check for the number of arguments before accessing them, which prevents the crash by returning an error instead. Patches 2-6 seem to set up test cases or configurations to reproduce and verify the issue, ensuring that such cases are caught in the future.

The label assigned is ""panic,"" but I'm thinking about whether this captures the essence of the problem. The issue isn't just a panic; it's more about an out-of-bounds memory access causing a crash. However, the term ""panic"" does describe the runtime error that occurs when the index is out of bounds.

So, while ""panic"" is part of the symptom, maybe other labels like ""crash,"" ""memory-safety,"" or ""out-of-bounds"" would be more precise. But since ""panic"" is a relevant and accurate description of what happens (the program crashes due to an error), I think it's acceptable.

I'm leaning towards yes, but I'm not 100% sure if there's a better label. Given the information, though, ""panic"" does fit because that's exactly what the proof of concept shows—a panic due to index out of bounds.
</think>

The label ""panic"" is appropriate as it accurately describes the runtime error causing the crash.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41661,bug,mvn spring-boot:build-image fails when 'classifier' is set to non-default value,Forward port of issue #26721 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the title and body of the issue.

The title says: ""mvn spring-boot:build-image fails when 'classifier' is set to non-default value."" That sounds like a problem where using a specific feature (the classifier) causes a failure, which indicates a bug because it shouldn't be failing under normal circumstances.

Looking at the body, it's just forwarding another issue. So not much info there, but the fact that it's being forwarded suggests it was already identified as an issue.

Now, looking at the patches. There are four patches provided. 

Patch 1 modifies some test methods. It looks like they're changing how tests are conducted when a classifier is used without repackaging and when it's used with repackaging. So maybe the tests were failing before because of incorrect behavior when classifiers weren't handled properly.

Patch 2 adds a new Maven project file (pom.xml) for a test case involving a classifier. This suggests they're setting up a scenario to replicate or test the issue, which makes sense if it's a bug that needed specific conditions to be triggered.

Patch 3 adds a Java source file with some code that keeps the application running by waiting on args. This might be part of the setup for testing the build process, ensuring that the image doesn't exit immediately and can be tested properly.

Patch 4 modifies the getArchiveFile method in some class. It changes comments about why project.getArtifact().getFile() isn't used because it's null after a forked lifecycle. Then, in getBackupFile, they adjust how backup files are handled based on classifiers. This seems like fixing logic around file handling when classifiers are non-default.

Putting this together, the problem arises when using a classifier (a Maven feature) which is causing build-image to fail. The patches adjust test cases and file handling logic related to classifiers, indicating that there was an issue in how these were managed before. 

Since the problem causes a failure and the changes fix that behavior, it's reasonable to label this as a bug because it's an unintended behavior that needed correction.
</think>

The issue describes a problem where using a non-default classifier causes `mvn spring-boot:build-image` to fail, which is a bug. The patches address test cases and file handling logic related to classifiers, confirming the fix for incorrect behavior.

@rustbot label F-type-alias-impl-trait",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what a regression is in software terms. A regression typically refers to a bug or issue that appears after a change was made to the codebase. It's when something that was previously working correctly stops working as intended, often due to a new feature, fix, or other modification.

Looking at the issue title: ""TAIT: closure and RPIT causes 'concrete type differs from previous defining opaque type use'"". TAIT probably stands for Type Alias Impl Trait. The error message suggests there's a type mismatch happening when using closures with these traits.

The body of the issue describes how replacing `-> impl Sized` with `-> F` in the `fn spawn` function makes it compile. This indicates that before this change, the code wasn't compiling because of the type error. The user also provided a minimized example from another repository, which helps identify where the problem might be occurring.

They included a playground link and some Rust code snippets. Let me look at those:

The first snippet has two functions: `spawn` and `spawn_task`. The `spawn` function is supposed to return an implementation of `Sized`, but in `spawn_task`, when they try to use it with a specific type `Tait`, the compiler throws an error about concrete types differing. The user then bisected the issue, identifying that the problem started on nightly-2024-03-16 and provided the commit hash where the regression occurred.

The patches provided don't seem to fix the issue but rather adjust the code to compile correctly by changing the function signature. So the original issue was causing a compilation error after a certain Rust nightly build, which suggests that something in Rust's compiler changed, introducing this bug.

Given all this, the user is pointing out that after a specific commit in Rust, their code stopped compiling. That fits the definition of a regression because it's an issue introduced by a change in the codebase (Rust's compiler in this case) that previously worked correctly.

Therefore, labeling this as a ""regression"" makes sense because the problem arose from a recent change, and it's not a new feature request or an existing bug that was always there. The bisect information also supports this, showing that the issue started after a specific commit.

</details>
",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""unsoundness"" accurately reflects the issue described in the given problem. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it's about placeholders not being allowed within types on item signatures for opaque types and other contexts. That suggests a compiler error related to type placeholders, which are underscore-based like `_`.

Next, I'll examine the body of the problem. It provides several code snippets where the placeholder `_` is used in different contexts, such as function return types, struct implementations, type aliases, etc. The compiler errors point out that using `_` in these item signatures isn't allowed and suggests replacing them with actual types or type parameters.

Now, looking at the patches made to resolve this issue. For example, one patch changes `fn impl_trait() -> impl BadTrait<_>` to `fn impl_trait<T>() -> impl BadTrait<T>`. This replaces the placeholder `_` with a type parameter `T`, which is a valid way to handle generics in Rust without using underscores.

Another patch modifies an associated constant from `const C: _;` to `const C: i32;`, replacing the underscore with a specific type, which makes sense because placeholders aren't allowed there either.

So, the problem revolves around incorrect use of `_` as a placeholder in various type contexts where they shouldn't be used. The patches fix these by using proper type annotations or parameters instead.

Now, what does ""unsoundness"" mean in this context? Unsoundness typically refers to situations where a programming language allows constructions that can lead to runtime errors or violate the type system's guarantees. For example, if the compiler allowed incorrect type placeholders, it might cause type safety issues.

In this case, using `_` in type signatures can lead to incorrect type inferences or bypass necessary checks, which could introduce unsoundness. By preventing the use of `_` in these contexts and requiring explicit types or parameters, Rust maintains its strong type system guarantees.

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""unsoundness"" seems appropriate because it deals with enforcing correct type usage to prevent potential violations of type safety.

This fails due to the file being opened as read-only:

<URL>

This could be fixed using windows specific permissions but it'd be simpler to just use `OpenOptions` with `write(true)`.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided title, body, and patches.

First, looking at the title: ""Bootstrap using `set_times` on a read-only file."" It mentions an issue during the bootstrap process where a specific function is used on a read-only file. 

In the body of the issue, there's a panic in the main thread due to an OS error 5 (Access Denied) when trying to set times on a file that was opened as read-only. The user suggests using `OpenOptions` with write access to fix it.

The patches provided show that they changed how the file is opened. Instead of using `File::open()`, which by default opens the file in read-only mode, they switched to `File::options().write(true).open()`. This change allows writing to the file, preventing the access denied error when setting times.

Now, considering what a ""runtime error"" means. Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program and prevent it from running as intended. In this case, the issue caused a panic, which is indeed a runtime error because it stops the program's execution. The problem arises dynamically while the code is executing, not at compile time.

Therefore, labeling this as ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately describes the issue because the problem occurred during the execution of the program, causing a panic and stopping its operation. This fits the definition of a runtime error.

### What did you expect to see?

Either the release notes are wrong or the new package is missing intended functionality.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""x/website: release notes for Go 1.22 mentions inexistent math/rand/v2.Uint()"". It says that the release notes mention a function that doesn't exist. So the problem here is about incorrect documentation or release notes.

The body of the issue explains that when trying to use `math/rand/v2.Uint()`, there was a compilation error because it doesn't exist. The user checked the CLs and thinks maybe it never existed, even though it's mentioned in the release notes. They expected either the release notes to be wrong or the package missing functionality.

So the main issue is that the documentation incorrectly listed `Uint()` as part of the new functions when it wasn't actually implemented. That's a problem because developers rely on release notes for updates and features.

Now, looking at the patch: it removes the line mentioning `Uint()`, meaning they fixed the documentation by removing the incorrect information. So this was a mistake in the documentation that needed correction.

The question is whether this should be labeled as a ""bug"". A bug usually refers to an issue in the code where something isn't working as intended, causing unexpected behavior or errors. In this case, the issue is about incorrect documentation, not a functional error in the code itself.

However, sometimes inaccuracies in release notes can mislead developers and cause issues, so they might be considered bugs in the documentation. But strictly speaking, it's more of a documentation error rather than a bug in the software.

But looking at how the label was applied: since the patch corrects the release notes by removing a non-existent function, and the problem was that the documentation was wrong, which can confuse users, perhaps the community considers this a bug because it affects user experience and trust in the documentation.

So, I think the label ""bug"" is appropriate here because the incorrect information in the release notes is treated as an issue needing a fix. The patch addresses this by correcting the documentation, so labeling it as a bug makes sense in this context.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""documentation"" is accurate for this issue report. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.

The user shared a detailed patch that modifies documentation files in a repository. The changes include updating sections related to Azure Artifacts, CodeArtifact, and other package managers. They added instructions on how to configure these services with uv, including setting up authentication tokens, installing necessary packages via pip, and enabling keyring providers. There are also notes about publishing packages to these repositories using the appropriate credentials.

The issue report itself doesn't explicitly state a problem but seems to be providing updated documentation. The user then asks if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects this report based on its title, body, and patches. They want me to output 1 if yes and 0 if no.

First, I need to determine what the issue is about. Since all the changes are in documentation files (like md files) and involve adding or modifying how-to guides for different package repositories, it's clear that this is about improving or updating the project's documentation. The patches don't fix a bug or add a new feature; they enhance the user guides.

The label ""documentation"" is typically used for issues related to creating, updating, or fixing documentation. In this case, the changes are all about documenting how to use uv with various package indexes, so it fits perfectly under documentation.

I should also consider if there's any other possible label that might be more accurate. The issue doesn't relate to a bug fix, feature request, or configuration change in the code itself. It's solely about explaining how to use existing features with different services.

Therefore, yes, the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects this issue report.

my only solution is downgrading spring boot 3.3.0 to 3.2.6

Fortunately, it works successfully in 3.2.6, but I report this bug.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""The value of the tomcat.threads.config.max metric is always -1, irrespective of the configured maximum number of threads."" That sounds like something isn't working as expected. The user set a max thread value in their application.yml, but when they check the Prometheus endpoint, it's showing -1 instead of 400. So that definitely points to unexpected behavior, which could be a bug.

Next, the body of the issue. They provided their configuration file where server.tomcat.threads.max is set to 400, and other related settings. They also mentioned trying to access the Prometheus actuator endpoint but seeing the metric as -1. They tried downgrading from Spring Boot 3.3.0 to 3.2.6, and it worked there. So this indicates that the issue was introduced in version 3.3.0, which is a strong sign of a regression bug.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are two patches here. Patch 1 modifies several parts of the code related to Tomcat thread configuration. They removed some imports and changed how the executor is configured. Instead of creating a StandardThreadExecutor directly, they're now using methods like customizeMaxThreads, which seems to set the values on the protocol handler. Also, in the test (Patch 2), instead of checking the executor's properties, they're now checking the protocol's properties directly.

So, from this, it looks like the issue was that Spring Boot wasn't correctly setting the Tomcat thread metrics when using certain configurations. The patch changes how these configurations are applied and where the values are read from, which explains why downgrading fixed it—because in 3.2.6, the code was different.

Putting it all together: The user encountered unexpected behavior (metric not reflecting configured value), provided steps to reproduce, tested a workaround by downgrading, and the patches address how thread configurations are set and retrieved. This fits the definition of a bug because it's an unintended behavior in the software that was resolved with code changes.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report as it describes unexpected behavior resolved by specific code changes.

rust-lang/rust,127890,dependency upgrade,Solve the pinned memchr problem,"Ever since <URL> the `memchr` crate has been pinned at 2.5.0. This is causing problems when trying to update things which depend on a newer version (like regex). This issue is to track trying to get that problem resolved.

The dependency is pinned because the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu target fails some tests with the 2.6.0 release. These tests fail when linking with ""undefined reference"" symbol errors in memchr (which ends up in the standard library via the `object` dependency for backtraces).

The errors look like:

````The log indicates an undefined reference to the `__imp__ZN6memchr4arch6x86_646memchr10memchr_raw2FN17h0aa7d2dff3bebec3E` symbol in the `.text` section of the object file `...-cgu.0.rcgu.o`.```

The underlying problem isn't with memchr. It's just that version 2.6 is just triggering a bug that has been around for a long while due to some refactoring of the code. 

### Reproduction

1. Edit [`rustc_ast/Cargo.toml`](<URL> and remove the `=` on memchr.

2. `cargo update -p memchr`

3. `./x test tests/ui --build=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --host=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
    - AFAIK, the defaults in config.toml should be fine (no profile).
    - As a reminder, to use the same mingw from CI, download <URL> extract that and add the `bin` directory to your PATH.

This currently fails these tests:

```The log shows that multiple UI (User Interface) tests related to external and LTO (Link-Time Optimization) features are being run. Specifically, it lists the following test cases:

1. `issue-64655-extern-rust-must-allow-unwind.rs` with thin slices 0, 1, 2, and 3.
2. `allow-unwind-when-calling-panic-directly.rs` with a thin slice.
3. `all-crates.rs`.
4. `lto-thin-rustc-loads-linker-plugin.rs`.
5. `thin-lto-inlines2.rs`.```

### Theories

This is likely some interaction with Thin LTO and `inline`.

A theory is that this is a bug in ld.bfd (just based on the evidence that it works with lld). However, it may also be possible that rustc is generating things in an incorrect way, and lld is just more tolerant of it.

Note that memchr is doing some fancy things with function pointers (<URL> with `inline(always)` functions.

### Notes

- As far as we know, updating binutils does not fix it. At the time of this writing, we are using version 2.38.
- <URL> contains an early discussion of this problem. 
- <URL> Another discussion that lead to this issue.
- <URL> -- windows-gnu thin-lto test linking error regression
  - I'm not sure if this is exactly the same issue, but seems very similar.
  - The thread-local inlining issue has a workaround in <URL>
- <URL> -- linking issue on x86_64-pc-windows-gnu target + thinLTO related to static function pointers
  - Unsure if this is the exact same issue.
- <URL> -- Pinned memchr to 2.5.0
- The unrecognized directive and `corrupt .drectve` warnings can (probably?) be ignored, they are only due to using an older version of binutils (<URL>


### Possible solutions

- Demote *-pc-windows-gnu and replace with *-pc-windows-gnullvm. To the best of our understanding, lld does not have this problem.
- Report this to the binutils maintainers to see if it is possible to fix it in ld.bfd.
- Is it possible to switch to gold or lld?
- Disable the tests on *-pc-windows-gnu until someone can fix the problem. This means any user using thin-lto will likely run into the same problem. Perhaps this will motivate one of them to try to fix it? 😉 

#### Non-solutions

- We could change the `inline` attribute in `memchr` for windows-gnu, but nobody wants to do that. It's not memchr's fault, and we don't want to paper over the real problem.
",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Solve the pinned memchr problem."" This suggests that the issue is about dealing with a specific problem related to the memchr crate being pinned at version 2.5.0. The body of the issue explains that updating memchr beyond 2.5.0 causes test failures on the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu target due to undefined reference errors. These errors are linked to issues with Thin LTO and function inlining.

The problem arises because memchr is pinned, preventing updates that depend on newer versions, like regex. The user provided steps to reproduce the issue by updating memchr and running specific tests, which fail. They also discussed possible solutions, such as switching linkers or demoting the target, but none of these were implemented in the patches.

Now looking at the patches applied: Patch 1 upgrades memchr from version 2.5.0 to 2.7.4 by changing the version number and checksum in Cargo.toml. It also removes memchr from another dependency list in a different file (Cargo.toml), possibly because it's no longer needed or handled elsewhere.

Patch 2 removes the explicit pinning of memchr at version 2.5.0, allowing it to be upgraded beyond that version by removing the line that sets memchr to ""=2.5.0"".

So both patches are directly related to changing the version of the memchr dependency. The first patch upgrades it and updates the checksum, while the second removes a constraint that was preventing the upgrade.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade."" Considering all this, the issue is indeed about upgrading the memchr crate from 2.5.0 to a newer version (2.7.4) to resolve the test failures caused by the pinning. The patches directly modify the dependency versions and constraints, which fits under the category of dependency upgrades.

Therefore, the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the issue report.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly captures the essence of the issue, which revolves around resolving problems caused by a pinned version of the memchr crate. The patches applied specifically address this by upgrading the dependency and removing constraints that prevented the update.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42743,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring RESTDocs 3.0.2,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Spring RESTDocs 3.0.2"". That immediately tells me that this is about updating a dependency to a newer version. The word ""upgrade"" here suggests moving from an older version to this specific one, which aligns with dependency management.

Next, the body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context provided beyond the title. However, the patches made are crucial here. Patch 1 shows that in a Gradle build file (based on the syntax), they're changing the library version from ""3.0.2-SNAPSHOT"" to ""3.0.2"". This change indicates moving from a snapshot (which is typically a development or unstable version) to a stable release.

Dependency upgrades usually involve updating the version numbers in project configurations, which is exactly what's happening here. The patch replaces the SNAPSHOT with a final release, which is a common practice when upgrading dependencies to more stable versions.

The label assigned was ""dependency upgrade"". Considering all these points—the title explicitly mentions an upgrade, and the patch shows changing the version number—it seems spot on. There's no mention of new features or bug fixes beyond what a dependency upgrade would entail. So yes, the label accurately reflects the issue.

As described in <URL> we can refactor the `BaseExecutor` and remove session context in `IndexLookUpExecutor` and `IndexReaderExecutor`.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this issue report and the changes made in the patches to determine whether the label ""refactoring"" is appropriate. 

First, the title of the issue isn't explicitly given, but based on the provided context, it seems like the main goal was to refactor the code by removing dependencies on `sessionctx.Context` and replacing them with a new `BaseExecutorV2` struct. The patches show that several files were modified to use this new structure instead of the old one.

Looking at each patch:

1. In multiple places, functions are being updated to pass additional parameters like `EnableRedactLog` and `Storage` instead of relying on `sessionctx.Context`. For example, in Patch 3, the `Reporter` struct is modified to include these new fields directly, removing the need to extract them from `Sctx`.

2. The creation of a new method `NewBaseExecutorV2` (Patch 6) suggests that there's an effort to create a more modular or updated version of the base executor, which aligns with refactoring.

3. Several test files and helper functions are adjusted to use `BaseExecutorV2` instead of the older `BaseExecutor`, indicating a deliberate shift in the code structure for better maintainability or functionality.

4. The removal of imports related to `sessionctx` (Patch 10) further supports that dependencies are being reduced, which is a common goal in refactoring to improve code cleanliness and reduce coupling.

The term ""refactoring"" typically refers to changes that improve code structure without altering its external behavior. In this case, the patches seem to be about restructuring how certain contexts and parameters are handled, moving towards a more encapsulated approach with `BaseExecutorV2`.

Therefore, the label ""refactoring"" does accurately reflect the nature of these changes.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43329,configuration,Use <annotationProcessorPaths> in Maven examples for configuring an annotation processor,"[JDK-8321319](<URL> will disable the automatic execution of annotation processors that are present on the classpath in Java 23+, because of [supply chain attack concerns](<URL> 

This would for instance mean that just adding `spring-boot-configuration-processor` as a dependency won't do anything until the annotation processor in that artifact is explicitly allowed to run.

I think Spring Boot will need to respond to this change in one way or another, either by documenting how users can deal with this (e.g. `maven-compiler-plugin`'s `annotationProcessorPaths`, using `maven-processor-plugin`, or dropping this protection again by setting `-proc:full` while that's still available) or by configuring `javac` to execute Spring's (or all?) annotation processors automatically.
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

Let's start by looking at the issue title: ""Use <annotationProcessorPaths> in Maven examples for configuring an annotation processor."" The title suggests that the problem is about how Maven configurations are set up to handle annotation processors. So it's related to Maven configuration.

Now the body of the issue explains that starting from Java 23+, automatic execution of annotation processors on the classpath is disabled due to supply chain concerns. It mentions that just adding a dependency like spring-boot-configuration-processor won't work unless explicitly allowed. The user suggests that Spring Boot should respond by either documenting how users can configure this, using maven-compiler-plugin's annotationProcessorPaths, or other methods.

So the issue is about configuring Maven to correctly handle annotation processors in response to Java changes. That definitely falls under configuration because it's about setting up build tools properly.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies the Maven plugin configuration from spring-boot-maven-plugin to maven-compiler-plugin and adds an annotationProcessorPaths section. This is a direct change to how dependencies are configured in the Maven build process, which is a configuration change.

Patch 2 similarly updates another part of the documentation or code, replacing a dependency declaration with a Maven compiler plugin configuration using annotationProcessorPaths. Again, this is about correctly setting up the build configuration.

Both patches involve changes to the Maven project's build configuration files, specifically adding paths for annotation processors. This clearly relates to how the project is configured in its build process.

The label assigned was ""configuration."" Considering that all these changes are about configuring Maven plugins and settings to handle annotation processors properly, it fits well under the configuration category. The issue isn't about a bug fix or a new feature but rather about adjusting configurations to adhere to new Java requirements.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue report.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33771,bug,PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver sorting of JAR resources,"`PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver` sorts files by name when loading via `PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver#doFindPathMatchingFileResources`. This behavior was probably introduced in the context of <URL>

However, when resources are loaded from a JAR file, the entries are not sorted in `doFindPathMatchingJarResources`. JAR files might be considered to have a stable order (in contrast to directory contents, which can vary depending on the OS/filesystem), and thus need no explicit sorting. However, in many scenarios, JAR files are produced by build processes that are platform-specific, leading to variations in the order of entries depending on where it was built.

**Wouldn't it make sense to sort the JAR entries alphabetically as well?**

In our case, the current implementation led to a difficult-to-debug issue:

We have a Spring Boot project consisting of multiple Gradle modules. For example:

1. application
2. lib-entities

The `application` module contains the Spring Boot application that initiates classpath scanning, while the `lib-entities` module contains the JPA entities. Since the entities are scanned from ""`lib-entities.jar`"", the scanner registers them in the order they appear in the JAR file, which is generated by Gradle and thus platform-specific. Hibernate respects the order of registered entities, which affects scenarios such as the generation of SQL statements involving multiple JOINs.

In our case, the SQL statements generated by Hibernate were ""unstable""; the exact behavior differed between CI/CD environments and local developer machines.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver sorting of JAR resources"". This suggests that the issue is about how resources from JAR files are being sorted when using a specific resolver class in Spring Framework.

Now, reading the body of the issue. The user explains that `PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver` sorts files by name when loading via `doFindPathMatchingFileResources`, but this behavior isn't applied to JAR resources in `doFindPathMatchingJarResources`. They argue that since JAR entries might have platform-specific ordering due to build processes, not sorting them can lead to issues. The user provided a specific scenario where this caused problems with Hibernate registering entities in an unstable order, affecting SQL generation differently across environments.

The patches provided show several changes. Let me go through each patch:

1. **Patch 1**: Removes some static variables related to caching class path manifest entries and modifies others. It replaces `jarEntryCache` with `jarEntriesCache`, which is now a NavigableSet instead of just a set, implying that the order matters.

2. **Patch 2**: Modifies how resources are added from JAR files. Instead of using a HashSet for `manifestEntries`, it uses a LinkedHashSet, which maintains insertion order. Similarly, in the method `getClassPathManifestEntriesFromJar`, another LinkedHashSet is used instead of a regular HashSet, and entries are collected by streaming and sorting them.

3. **Patch 3**: In the `doFindPathMatchingJarResources` method, the cache for JAR entries is now filled using a TreeSet (which sorts elements) and streams entries with sorting applied before adding to the set. This ensures that when entries are retrieved from the cache, they're in a consistent order.

All these changes indicate that the problem was due to the lack of sorting when loading resources from JAR files, leading to inconsistent behavior across different environments. The patches introduce sorting to ensure a stable order, which fixes the bug described.

Since the issue describes an unintended behavior (resources not being sorted as expected) and provides code changes to fix it by adding sorting, this is indeed a bug in the system. Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""datetime"" is appropriate for this issue based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

Looking at the patches and the surrounding context, it seems that the changes are related to the use of pidfd (process file descriptors) in the Go runtime. Pidfds are a Linux feature that allows processes to be managed via file descriptors, which can enhance security and simplify certain operations.

The patches show several functions being removed or modified, such as those dealing with `pidfdRelease`, `pidfdSendSignal`, and `ensurePidfd`. There's also mention of checking whether pidfd-related syscalls work correctly. These are all low-level system calls and process management features.

Now, the label in question is ""datetime"". That usually refers to issues related to date and time handling, such as formatting, timezone issues, or timestamp calculations. 

I don't see any connection between the patches made and datetime functionality. The changes are about process management and system calls, not about dates or times. Therefore, the label ""datetime"" doesn't seem relevant here.

So, the answer should be 0 because the label doesn't accurately reflect the issue.

The label ""datetime"" does not accurately reflect this issue report as it pertains to process management with pidfd rather than date/time handling.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""cleanup"" is appropriate for this issue report based on the information provided. Let me start by understanding what the issue seems to be about and then look at how it was addressed.

The title of the issue isn't explicitly given, but from the patches provided, it looks like there were several changes made in the TiDB repository related to partition management during DDL operations. The problem appears to involve handling different states (like DeleteOnly, Public) when reorganizing partitions and ensuring data consistency.

Looking at the first patch, it modifies how partitions are located during reorganization by checking the correct definitions based on the DDL state. It also sets a skipAssert flag for certain partitions, which affects whether assertions are made about the existence of keys in transactions. This seems to be addressing issues where data might not be correctly placed or checked during partition operations.

The second patch removes a function called shouldAssert and replaces it with a check on the skipAssert field within TableCommon. It also modifies how transaction assertions are set based on this flag. This change suggests that there was a need to streamline or refactor the assertion logic, possibly making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Other patches adjust conditions where certain operations (like adding records) should be skipped based on the DDL state of partitions. These changes seem aimed at preventing incorrect data handling during specific partition operations, which could have led to bugs or inconsistencies before.

Considering all these changes, they appear to focus on refactoring and improving the code structure related to partition management, especially around how different DDL states are handled. The term ""cleanup"" in software development often refers to refactoring code to make it cleaner, more efficient, or easier to maintain without changing functionality.

The patches don't introduce new features but rather adjust existing logic to handle edge cases better and improve the overall robustness of the partitioning system. They also remove redundant functions and variables, which is a common part of code cleanup activities.

Therefore, applying the ""cleanup"" label makes sense because these changes are primarily about improving code quality, reducing redundancy, and ensuring that the partition operations behave correctly under various DDL states without introducing new features.

### Additional information

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided details.

First, looking at the issue title: it says that `fs.fstat` results in an abort with some arguments. So the problem is about a function causing the process to crash when given certain inputs.

In the body, the user describes steps to reproduce the bug. They install a package and run some JavaScript code that uses `parseFileIndexFD` from 'lzma-native', which leads to a Node.js instance crashing with an abort. The error message mentions a fatal error related to v8 and a native stack trace, indicating it's a low-level issue.

The expected behavior is that errors should be thrown as exceptions, not causing the entire process to crash. But instead, they're seeing a hard crash, which suggests an unhandled exception or a bug in the runtime.

Looking at the patches provided: 

Patch 1 modifies how specific error types are determined, handling when the input is a Symbol by converting it into a string for better error reporting. This seems to be about improving error messages when invalid arguments (like Symbols) are passed to functions expecting certain types.

Patch 2 adds a test that checks if passing a Symbol to `fs.fstat` throws an `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` error. This indicates that previously, such invalid usage was causing a crash instead of throwing an appropriate error.

So the issue is about improper argument types leading to process aborts rather than proper error handling. The root cause seems to be that when certain functions (like fs.fstat) receive unexpected argument types (e.g., Symbols), Node.js doesn't handle it gracefully, leading to a runtime crash.

The label ""runtime error"" typically refers to errors that occur during the execution of the program, such as type errors or division by zero. However, in this case, the problem is more about incorrect handling of invalid arguments leading to a process abort, which could be considered a bug in the runtime's error handling rather than a typical runtime error.

But wait, ""runtime error"" might still apply because it's an error during execution that's not being properly caught or handled. The patches are adding proper error checking and ensuring that such cases throw exceptions instead of crashing. So the issue does relate to how the runtime handles errors when invalid arguments are passed, which is a type of runtime error.

Alternatively, maybe ""bug"" would be more accurate because it's about incorrect behavior in the Node.js code leading to crashes. However, since the label given is ""runtime error"", I need to decide if that fits. Runtime errors usually refer to issues during execution, like unhandled exceptions or type mismatches causing the program to fail. In this case, passing invalid arguments causes a crash, which could be classified under runtime errors because they occur when the code runs.

So considering all this, ""runtime error"" seems appropriate as it's an issue that arises during execution and is related to how the runtime environment handles certain operations.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue because the problem occurs during execution due to improper handling of invalid arguments, leading to a process crash instead of throwing an appropriate exception. The patches address this by improving error handling.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""code generation"" accurately reflects the provided issue report and the associated patches. Let's start by understanding what each part tells us.

First, looking at the issue report title: it just says ""code generation."" That’s a bit vague, but the body includes multiple code patches made to various files in a repository. The patches involve changes to functions related to generating kernel code for CUDA using Triton, handling arguments, and adding support for different data types.

The majority of the patches modify how arguments are handled in code generation. For example, several functions like `add_numel_to_call_args_and_grid` and `get_call_args` are updated to include or handle `arg_types`. This suggests that the changes are about correctly passing argument types during the code generation process.

In patch 12, there's a specific mention of collecting `arg_types` for each argument when generating a C++ wrapper. This is crucial because in C++, knowing the type of each argument is essential for correct function signatures and memory management. Without proper type handling, the generated code could have bugs or fail to compile.

Additionally, functions like `generate_user_defined_triton_kernel` are being passed `arg_types`, indicating that the kernel generation process now requires type information. This implies that the changes ensure the generated code correctly uses the right data types for each argument, improving compatibility and preventing potential runtime errors.

Overall, all these patches revolve around enhancing how the code generator handles different data types of function arguments when producing CUDA kernels or C++ wrappers. Therefore, the label ""code generation"" fits because it directly relates to improvements in generating correct and type-safe code.
</think>

The patches focus on correctly handling argument types during code generation for CUDA kernels and C++ wrappers, ensuring type safety and correctness.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""filesystem"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Do not offer 'Create file' option for readonly file systems"". The problem here seems related to how VS Code handles read-only filesystems. When a user tries to open a non-existent file in such a system, it incorrectly offers an option to create the file, which isn't possible and leads to an error.

The body of the issue includes steps to reproduce the bug, mentioning that on a readonly filesystem, attempting to open a missing file brings up a dialog with a ""create file"" option. Clicking this results in an error because it can't actually create the file. The reporter suggests not showing the create option in such cases.

The patches provided show changes in the code where they added a check using `IFilesConfigurationService` to determine if the filesystem is read-only. This means that when the system is readonly, the ""Create File"" option won't be offered anymore.

Now, considering the label ""filesystem"". The issue revolves around how VS Code interacts with the file system, specifically handling readonly permissions and preventing incorrect user options in such scenarios. Since the problem and solution are directly tied to file system behavior and configuration, ""filesystem"" seems appropriate.

I don't see any aspects of this issue that would suggest a different label like ""bug"", ""ui"", or something else. It's all about how the application interacts with filesystem permissions and handles errors accordingly.
</think>

The label ""filesystem"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to the handling of read-only file systems within VS Code.

spring-projects/spring-framework,33687,security,Remove support for relative paths in static resource handling,"Following thes updates to URL parsing in #33639, it's clear that with the [WhatWg URL Living Standard](<URL> spec, there is no good reason to expect URL paths that are not normalized. Those have been a source of security issues, and while we have protections against them in static resource handling, and they are also rejected by the Spring Security firewall, we can now drop support for them altogether going forward.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""security"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Remove support for relative paths in static resource handling."" That makes me think they're changing how static resources are handled, specifically removing something related to relative paths. Relative paths often involve things like ""../"" which can be tricky because they can navigate up directories.

Now, the body of the issue says that after some updates (referencing #33639), it's clear that with the WhatWG URL spec, there's no need for unnormalized URL paths anymore. They mention that such paths have been a source of security issues. Even though they had protections in place and were also blocked by Spring Security, they're now dropping support entirely.

So from the body, it seems like the reason for removing relative paths is tied to security concerns because these paths caused issues before and the current setup can't handle them as securely anymore, so they're removing support to prevent future problems.

Looking at the patches: There are a few changes. Patch 1 modifies a condition in `isInvalidPath` from checking if the path contains "".."" and then after cleaning, contains ""../"", to just checking for ""../"". So it's simplifying the condition but still targeting paths with ""../"".

Patch 2 adds another test case that includes ""/testsecret/test/../secret.txt"", which seems to be testing for a relative path within the URL.

Patches 3 is similar to Patch 1 but maybe in a different part of the code, again adjusting how paths are validated.

Patch 4 adds a new test case in `shouldRejectInvalidPath` with ""/testsecret/test/../secret.txt"". So they're expanding their tests to cover more scenarios where relative paths might slip through.

Putting it all together: The issue is about removing support for relative paths because they've been a security risk. They're adjusting the code to reject such paths more effectively, which improves security by preventing potential traversal attacks or unauthorized access through malformed URLs.

So the label ""security"" definitely fits here because the changes are aimed at closing a security vulnerability related to how paths are handled.

This led to a `LoadError` indicating that the test run failed with errors. The stack trace shows that the error originated from a test file located in the Julia source code repository.```
The difference in the two appears to be in the `cab8` vs `cab9` segments.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""randomness"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem.

The issue title is about a CI test failure in UUIDs with `uuid7(Xoshiro(0))`. The body of the issue shows an error where two UUIDs generated with Xoshiro(0) are different when they should be the same. Specifically, the test expected them to be equal but they weren't because of a small difference in one part of the UUID.

Looking at the patches provided, I see that there were changes made to functions `uuid1` and `uuid7`. In both cases, the code was refactored to use helper functions `_build_uuid1` and `_build_uuid7`, which take an RNG and a timestamp. The key change seems to be in how these UUIDs are generated using the provided RNG.

The test that failed initially was checking if two calls with the same RNG produce the same UUID, but they didn't. After the patches, new tests were added to ensure that when an RNG is passed to `uuid1`, `uuid4`, and `uuid7`, the output is consistent, meaning it doesn't change with each call given the same seed.

So, the problem was that the UUIDs weren't being generated deterministically when using a specific RNG. The fix ensures that the RNG is used correctly to produce stable outputs, which relates directly to how randomness is handled in the UUID functions.

Therefore, the label ""randomness"" accurately reflects this issue because it deals with ensuring the correct and consistent generation of random numbers for UUIDs, especially when a specific RNG is provided.
</think>

The label ""randomness"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to ensuring consistent UUID generation using a specified RNG. The changes in the patches directly address how randomness is handled to fix the test failure.

sveltejs/svelte,12892,rendering,Svelte 5: Slot not render content for customElements,"### Describe the bug

First of all ... sorry for my bad english.

This is a Release Canditate ... therefore I hope my report is not to early for Svelte 5.

### My background and goal:
I have build a lib(bundle) with many custom elements based on Svelte 3 and in some cases also based on Svelte 4. So I naturally watched the development of Svelte 5 with excitement. In order to make the best decision as to whether it makes sense to upgrade all my components to Svelte 4 and then migrate to Svelte 5, I decided to get to know all the features of Svelte 5 first. In this case I try to migrate a first little button component of my existing lib (components bundle).

### The problem:
In my migration test I tried to migrate all exactly by the current svelte 5 docs:
<URL>
In my test there will no content (Text: **Button Text in Slot**) rendered which I have placed inside my button element:
```The code snippet is an HTML tag representing a button with the class attribute `cow-ps-button` and an attribute `exclude-validation`. The button contains the text ""Button Text in Slot"".```


### Reproduction

### Github Test Repo
I have created a example repo where I can show my problem.
<URL>

---

### Using
Here I use my test customElement `cow-ps-button` in the **index.html**:
<URL>

#### Example:
```The code snippet is an HTML tag using a custom component `<cow-ps-button>` with an attribute `exclude-validation` and text ""Button Text in Slot"" provided within the button's content.```
_Note in passing for the showed **exclude-validation** attribute: I hope that kebab-case attributes now possible in Svelte 5.x. And I hope my implementation here is also correct._

### Svelte Component (customElement)
... and this is my svelte component implementation:

### Result in DOM (Developer Tools):
This is the result in the DOM:

Unfortunately ... **No errors occurred**. 

### Logs

```The log indicates that no errors occurred and no additional logs were printed.```


### System Info

```The system is running Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) on a Linux OS with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D 16-core CPU and 30.48 GB of RAM. It is using Bash version 5.2.15 as the shell and supports containers. The system has Node.js version 21.7.1 and npm version 10.5.0 installed. Additionally, it has Brave Browser and Chrome installed.```


### Severity

blocking an upgrade",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""rendering"" accurately reflects the GitHub issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The title of the issue is ""Svelte 5: Slot not render content for customElements"". That immediately tells me that the problem is related to slots in Svelte 5 when using custom elements, and the content isn't rendering as expected.

Looking at the body, the user describes a bug where slot content inside a custom element isn't being rendered. They provided a reproduction repository, which shows that when they use their custom button component with a slot containing text, it doesn't appear in the DOM. The issue seems to be specific to Svelte 5's handling of slots within custom elements.

Now, considering the patches made to resolve this issue:

1. **Patch 1** introduces a fix allowing mixing of slots and snippets in custom element mode. This suggests that the problem was with how slots were handled when using custom elements.
   
2. **Patch 2** modifies the analysis to check for slot usage specifically when not in custom element mode, indicating that the issue was related to slot handling in custom elements.

3. **Patch 3** adds documentation about the `custom_element` property, which ties into how Svelte handles components as custom elements.

4. **Patch 4 and Patch 5** both add notes about using `<slot />` in custom elements and mention future changes, reinforcing that slots are still supported but might change, which directly relates to rendering issues with slot content.

All these patches address the problem of slots not rendering correctly when using custom elements in Svelte 5. The main issue is that the content placed inside a slot wasn't appearing, which falls under rendering because it's about how and what gets displayed on the screen.

The label assigned was ""rendering"". Since the core of the problem is the failure to render slot content within custom elements, this label seems appropriate. It accurately captures the essence of the issue—the component isn't rendering the expected content from the slot.

I don't see any other aspects like performance or security here; it's strictly about the rendering behavior. Therefore, the ""rendering"" label correctly reflects the problem described in the issue report.

nodejs/node,54465,enhancement,Persist the V8 code cache before spawning a child process,"### What is the problem this feature will solve?

[`NODE_COMPILE_CACHE`](<URL> persists the V8 code cache when the process is terminating which means that if the script spawns itself then that child process wont benefit from the cache.

### What is the feature you are proposing to solve the problem?

Persist the V8 code cache before spawning a child process so it can benefit from the cache.

```The code checks if the second command-line argument is ""foo"". If true, it logs ""foo"". Otherwise, it executes `node test.mjs foo` to persist the V8 code cache and logs the output.```

### What alternatives have you considered?

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, the issue title is ""Persist the V8 code cache before spawning a child process."" That sounds like they're proposing a change to how the code cache is handled when creating child processes. The body explains that currently, the cache is only saved when the process terminates, which isn't helpful if the parent spawns children because those children can't use the cached code.

Looking at the patches, there are four of them. Patch 1 modifies how the cache is written to disk by using temporary files and renaming them, which seems like a change in functionality rather than fixing a bug. Patches 2 and 4 add new fields and methods related to tracking whether the cache has been persisted. Patch 3 introduces a new function FlushCompileCache() and updates how the compile cache handler is managed.

So, putting it together: these changes are introducing a new feature or improving an existing one by allowing the V8 code cache to be saved before spawning child processes, which wasn't possible before. This means that the issue isn't about fixing a bug but rather adding a new capability to enhance performance when dealing with child processes.

Therefore, labeling this as an ""enhancement"" makes sense because it's improving functionality rather than resolving an issue or bug.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42282,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring HATEOAS 2.3.3,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. The issue has a title: ""Upgrade to Spring HATEOAS 2.3.3"", and an empty body. Then there are patches provided that show changes in the code.

Looking at Patch 1, it shows that in the build.gradle file, the version for Spring HATEOAS was updated from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3. That's a clear indication that they're upgrading a dependency.

Patch 2 also modifies the releaseNotes URL, but that seems like a minor fix or maybe just updating where the notes are pulled from, not necessarily another dependency upgrade.

The other patches don't seem directly related to dependencies but rather to release notes formatting. So the main action here is the version change of Spring HATEOAS.

Since the issue's title explicitly mentions upgrading Spring HATEOAS and the patch confirms that by updating its version number in the build file, it definitely fits under a dependency upgrade. The label ""dependency upgrade"" makes sense because they're updating an existing library to a newer version.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it involves updating a dependency's version.

angular/angular,56030,template,Control flow migrations produces broken code when ngSwitchCase is used as text attribute,"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?

core

### Is this a regression?

No

### Description

When `ngSwitchCase` is used without `*` or `[]`, the `@angular/core:control-flow` schematic produces code that doesn't compile:

```This code snippet uses Angular's `ngSwitch` directive to conditionally render different content based on the value of `value`. If `value` is an empty string, it displays ""empty string""; if `value` is ""foo"", it displays ""\""foo\"""". Otherwise, no matching case will display anything.```
gets converted to

```This code snippet appears to be using a switch-case syntax, possibly in a templating language like Blade used in Laravel. It checks the `value` and outputs different strings based on the condition.```

when it should be

```This code snippet uses a switch statement to check the value and outputs different strings based on the condition. If `value` is an empty string, it outputs ""empty string""; if `value` is 'foo', it outputs '""foo""'.```

### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug

<URL>

### Please provide the exception or error you saw

```The application bundle generation failed due to two errors from the angular-compiler plugin:

1. An `@case` block must have exactly one parameter.
2. A property `foo` does not exist on the `AppComponent` type.```


### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)

```The log shows the version information for Angular CLI, Node.js, npm, and other related packages on a Linux system. Angular CLI version is 18.0.0, Node.js version is 20.9.0, npm version is 10.1.0, and the OS is Linux x64. It also lists the versions of Angular itself and various Angular-related packages such as @angular-devkit/architect, @angular-devkit/build-angular, and rxjs.```


### Anything else?

We encountered this when migrating a real project at work, there's a more practical example in the linked repo based on the real code.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""template"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what each part of the problem says.

The issue title is about control flow migrations producing broken code when using ngSwitchCase as a text attribute. The body explains that when ngSwitchCase is used without the asterisk or brackets, the generated code doesn't compile correctly. They provided an example where empty and 'foo' cases are converted incorrectly. 

Looking at the patches, Patch 1 modifies how the condition is handled in the migration. It checks if the attribute value is empty and replaces it with `''` to fix the syntax error. Patch 2 adds a test case ensuring that empty strings and other values are correctly wrapped in quotes when migrated.

Now, considering the label ""template."" From what I know, Angular's ngSwitchCase is part of template syntax, so issues related to how these directives are processed in templates would fall under this category. The problem here is about incorrect code generation during migration affecting the switch cases in the template. Therefore, the patches directly address how the template is transformed.

So yes, ""template"" seems appropriate because it's about the Angular template syntax and its migration issues.
</think>

The label ""template"" accurately reflects the issue since it deals with Angular template syntax and migration problems related to ngSwitchCase directives.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""properties"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""DataSourceProperties fail to bind if java.sql module isn't included."" The key terms here are DataSourceProperties and a missing java.sql module. It seems related to configuration properties not binding correctly because of a module dependency issue.

Next, the body of the issue describes a ClassNotFoundException for javax.sql.DataSource and java.sql.SQLException. The user also mentions that adding 'requires java.sql;' to module-info.java fixes the problem. They provided a stack trace pointing to issues during class loading, specifically when trying to bind properties under 'spring.datasource' to DataSourceProperties.

So, the core of the issue is about a failure in binding properties due to missing dependencies, which leads to runtime exceptions. The user also included a reproducible example and patches that modify certain configuration classes.

Looking at the patches, Patch 1 modifies the @ConditionalOnClass annotation in DataSourceTransactionManagerAutoConfiguration by adding DataSource.class to the list of required classes. This means the auto-configuration will now only be applied if DataSource is present on the classpath, which ties back to the missing java.sql module issue.

Patch 2 adds a test case that checks if DataSourceProperties are not loaded when DataSource isn't available. This ensures that the configuration doesn't try to bind properties when the necessary classes aren't there, thus preventing the error.

Now, considering the label assigned is ""properties."" The issue revolves around the binding of properties in Spring Boot's DataSourceProperties class failing due to a missing module. The patches adjust how the auto-configuration checks for required classes before attempting to bind these properties. So, the problem and solution are indeed related to configuration properties and their binding.

However, I'm thinking if ""properties"" is the most precise label here. While it's correct that properties binding fails, the root cause is more about module dependencies (specifically java.sql) affecting auto-configuration. But in the context of Spring Boot issues, ""properties"" might be a suitable category because it directly relates to the application's configuration properties not being correctly applied.

Alternatively, labels like ""dependencies,"" ""auto-configuration,"" or ""classpath"" might also fit, but since the report is about the failure in binding properties under 'spring.datasource', ""properties"" does capture the essence of the issue.

Therefore, I agree that the label ""properties"" accurately reflects this issue because it's primarily about the failure to bind configuration properties due to missing dependencies, and the patches directly address how those properties are handled when certain classes aren't present.
</think>

The label ""properties"" is appropriate as it reflects the core issue of failing to bind DataSourceProperties. The patches address this by adjusting auto-configuration based on class availability, thus ensuring proper handling of configuration properties.

### What did you do?

I ran `mkerrors.sh` in the `unix` directory in order to regenerate `zerrors_aix_ppc64.go` according to the README.

### What did you see happen?

The process crashed with a segfault:

```The log shows that the user navigated to the directory `/home/jtroy/src/sys/unix` and executed a script `mkerrors.sh` with specific environment variables set (`CC=gcc-12`, `GOOS=aix`, `GOARCH=ppc64`). The script generated a Go code snippet listing various signals along with their numbers, names, and descriptions. At the end, the script attempted to run a compiled Go program named `_errors` using `$GORUN`, which resulted in a segmentation fault and core dump with process ID `24052120`.```

### What did you expect to see?

I expected `mkerrors.sh` to produce complete output on aix/ppc64 without crashing.

Debugging further:
````The log shows that the `./mkerrors.sh` script encountered a segmentation fault when trying to run `$GORUN./_errors`. Using `gdb` to debug the core dump revealed that the segmentation fault occurred in the `strncpy` function at `_errors.c:245`. The variable `e` had a value of 255, which caused an issue when passed to `strncpy`. The signal `SIGSEGV` indicates a segmentation fault, and the debugger showed that the problematic line was attempting to copy a string representation of the signal number into the `buf` buffer.```

The program attempts to call strsignal() against SIGMAX64, which is not a real signal and is not a valid thing to do. Digging further, it seems the intent is to [filter SIGMAX64 out with grep](<URL> but using a GNU syntax which doesn't behave the same way with AIX's grep. It looks like it may have broken in [x/sys #137](<URL> The OS is AIX 7.3.

I've submitted a proposed fix in <URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""x/sys/unix: mkerrors.sh broken on AIX"". The word ""broken"" suggests something isn't working as expected. Now, the body of the issue explains that when running `mkerrors.sh`, the process crashes with a segfault. Segfaults are segmentation faults, which typically indicate a crash due to invalid memory access.

The user provided the output showing that the script failed with a segmentation fault. They also included debugging steps using gdb, which pointed to a problem in the `strncpy` function when handling a signal named SIGMAX64. It seems this signal isn't valid, leading to the crash.

They mentioned that the issue arises because of a grep command that's supposed to filter out certain signals but doesn't work correctly on AIX due to using GNU syntax. They linked a previous pull request where this might have been broken and provided their own fix in another PR.

Looking at the patches they applied, both changes involve modifying `grep` commands to use extended regular expressions with `-E` and changing the pattern from using `\|` to using `|` within parentheses. This suggests that the original issue was due to incorrect filtering of signals because the grep command wasn't handling the patterns as expected on AIX.

So, putting it all together: the script crashes because it tries to process an invalid signal, leading to a segmentation fault. The patches fix this by correctly filtering out unwanted signals using the right regex syntax for AIX's grep.

The label assigned is ""crash"", which directly relates to the segmentation fault described. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue.

astral-sh/uv,5428,rename,Rename `--isolated` to `--no-config`,With an alias and a deprecation warning.,1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""rename"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Rename `--isolated` to `--no-config`"". That clearly suggests that a renaming is happening. The word ""rename"" is right there, so that's a strong indication.

Next, the body says, ""With an alias and a deprecation warning."" This means they're not just changing the name but also adding an alias for the old flag and a warning when it's used. So, this reinforces that renaming is a key part of the issue.

Now, looking at the patches:

Patch 1 adds documentation for `UV_NO_CONFIG`, which relates to the new flag. It explains what the option does, indicating that the environment variable is being renamed or added as a replacement.

Patch 2 modifies the CLI struct by adding a `no_config` field with the new argument and environment variable setup. This shows that the command-line interface now has this new option, replacing the old one.

Patch 3 changes the condition in the code from checking `cli.global_args.isolated` to checking both `isolated` and `no_config`. So, it's not just renaming but also integrating the new flag into how the application behaves.

Patch 4 updates the help text in multiple places to include the new `--no-config` option. This ensures that users are informed about the change through the command-line help, which is part of the rename process.

Putting this all together: the issue is about renaming a command-line flag from `--isolated` to `--no-config`, complete with updating documentation, code logic, and user help information. All these patches support the idea that a renaming took place along with necessary updates to maintain functionality and inform users.

Therefore, the label ""rename"" accurately captures the essence of this issue.
</think>

The label ""rename"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves renaming `--isolated` to `--no-config`, supported by code changes.

Alright, I need to determine whether the label ""syntax"" correctly reflects the issue described in the provided details. Let me start by understanding what's being discussed here.

The user presented a series of patches made to a Vim syntax file for TypeScript and TypeScript with React (JSX). The patches modify various aspects of how the syntax is highlighted and parsed. For instance, there are changes related to function definitions, arrow functions, async/await keywords, destructuring variables, and JSX syntax handling.

Looking at the title and body of the issue report, it's clear that the focus is on improving or fixing the syntax highlighting for TypeScript in Vim. The patches adjust how different code elements are recognized and displayed, which falls under syntax-related changes.

The label ""syntax"" is assigned to this issue. Considering that all the changes are about how the code is parsed and highlighted, this label seems appropriate. It accurately reflects that the problem pertains to syntax handling in the Vim plugin.

Therefore, I conclude that the label ""syntax"" is indeed accurate for this issue.

3. Lists the wheel file in the `wheels` directory.
4. Freezes installed packages and filters to show Indico package details.```

</details>",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""`uv pip install something.whl` does not install the new version."" This suggests that when using `uv pip install` with a wheel file, it doesn't update to a newer version even though it should. That sounds like unexpected behavior, which is typically considered a bug.

Next, the body of the issue describes how installing from a local wheel doesn't update the package if a different version exists. The user provided steps to reproduce, including specific commands and outputs. They showed that after installing version 3.3.3, attempting to install 3.3.4 didn't change anything because `uv` thought it was already installed. This indicates a problem with how `uv pip install` handles wheel files, especially when versions differ but the package name is the same.

The verbose output shows that during the second installation, `uv pip install` recognized the new version but still considered the requirement as satisfied because it found the older version in the freeze list. That's not the expected behavior when a newer wheel is provided. Instead of installing the new version, it just audited and did nothing, which is a bug.

Looking at the patches that resolved this issue: Patch 1 changes the return value from `Self::Satisfied` to `Self::Mismatch` when there's a path mismatch. This means that `uv` now correctly identifies that the installed version doesn't match the requested one, allowing it to proceed with installation. Patch 2 updates a test case, renaming it and adjusting the expected output to reflect that installing a new version from a different wheel actually replaces the old one.

These changes confirm that the problem was a bug in how `uv` handled direct path installations when versions changed. It wasn't just a feature request or an enhancement but a fix for incorrect behavior. Therefore, labeling this as ""bug"" is accurate because it addresses a flaw in the software's functionality.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue report because it describes unexpected behavior where installing a newer wheel version doesn't update the package, which was fixed by patches changing how version mismatches are handled.

### Logs and stack traces

Alright, let's break down this problem step by step. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They provided a series of code patches related to a Vim plugin called termdebug and asked whether the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the issue based on the provided context.

Looking at the patches, they seem to address several issues in the termdebug plugin. The main focus appears to be on improving error handling, particularly when certain files or folders with specific names exist in the current directory. For example, if a user has a file named 'gdb' or 'Termdebug-asm-listing', the plugin previously might have caused errors or unexpected behavior.

The patches modify functions related to buffer names and add sanity checks to prevent these issues. They also include tests to ensure that the plugin behaves correctly when such files exist. Additionally, there's a test for preventing multiple instances of termdebug from running simultaneously.

Now, considering the label ""type system"": this usually refers to how a programming language handles data types, their definitions, and operations. It involves features like type checking, type inference, and polymorphism. However, in the context of these patches, there's no direct mention or implication of changes related to data types within the termdebug plugin. The focus is more on error handling, file management, and preventing race conditions.

Given that the patches are about ensuring the plugin doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly due to conflicting filenames and improving its robustness, the label ""type system"" doesn't seem appropriate. Instead, labels like ""bug fix,"" ""error handling,"" or ""robustness"" would be more accurate.

Therefore, the label assigned doesn't reflect the actual changes made in the patches.
</think>

The label ""type system"" does not accurately reflect this issue report. The patches address error handling and robustness rather than type system issues.

**Note:**
This issue was created using new test triage automation. Please report issues or feedback to es-delivery.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[CI] XPackRestIT test {p0=rollup/security_tests/Index-based access} failing"". This tells me that a specific test is failing in the CI environment. The test is related to X-Pack's REST IT (Integration Test), specifically the Index-based access part of security tests.

Moving on to the body, there are several sections. Under ""Build Scans"", there are links to build results where this issue occurs. The reproduction line shows how to run the failing test using Gradle with specific parameters. It mentions that it's applicable to the main branch and notes that it doesn't reproduce locally, which suggests it's an environment-specific issue in CI.

The failure message is a Java AssertionError stating that at a certain point (rollup/security_tests:176), an expected value of 1 was not met; instead, it got 0. This indicates a test assertion failed because the condition wasn't satisfied.

In the ""Issue Reasons"" section, it's mentioned there are two failures in this specific test with a low failure rate over many executions, pointing to some intermittent issue or specific condition causing the test to fail occasionally.

Now, looking at the patch provided: it removes an entry from a list of tests. Specifically, it removes the XPackRestIT.test for Index-based access. So the fix here was to exclude this failing test, possibly because it's flaky or the failure isn't critical, or maybe there's another issue that needs addressing elsewhere.

The label assigned is ""runtime error"". I'm trying to see if this fits. A runtime error usually refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program, like exceptions or crashes. However, in this case, it's a test failure due to an assertion error. The test itself is failing because of an unexpected result, but that doesn't necessarily mean there was a runtime error in the application code.

The patches don't fix any actual errors in the code but rather remove the failing test from the list. This suggests that the issue wasn't a runtime error but perhaps a test reliability problem or a bug in the test case itself. Alternatively, it could be an issue with how the CI environment is set up if it's not reproducing locally.

So, considering all this, the label ""runtime error"" might not accurately capture the nature of the issue. It was more about a failing test due to an assertion failure rather than a runtime exception or error in the code execution.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" does not accurately reflect the issue report because the problem is a test failure due to an assertion error, not an actual runtime error. The patches removed a failing test instead of fixing application code.

""prefix not found"" is the error message from StripPrefixError",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""workspace"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""prefix not found"" in nested uv init. This suggests that there was an error when initializing a project within another project, which could relate to how workspaces are handled.

Next, the body describes the steps to reproduce. The user initializes a project and then tries to initialize a subproject within it, which leads to an error about a missing prefix. The error message is from StripPrefixError, indicating a path handling issue.

Now, examining the patches that fixed the problem:

Patch 1 modifies the `init` function by canonicalizing the path. This change likely resolves the path correctly when initializing nested projects, preventing the ""prefix not found"" error.

Patch 2 adds a test for initializing a relative sub-package within a workspace. It creates a workspace and initializes a member package, then checks if everything is set up correctly. The test ensures that the nested initialization works without errors.

The assigned label is ""workspace."" Given that both patches are about handling paths in workspaces and ensuring that nested projects initialize properly, this label seems appropriate. The issue was about initializing a subproject (a workspace member), which aligns with the ""workspace"" category.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem and its solution.
</think>

The label ""workspace"" is appropriate because the issue and patches deal with initializing subprojects within a workspace context, addressing path handling that's specific to workspace operations.

✅ Results in this output when executed with `php8.3` (also `php8.2` and `php8.1` and `php8.0`):
```The code snippet `helloworld` appears to be a simple string literal.```

❌ But results in this output when executed with `phpdbg8.3` (also `phpdbg8.2` and `phpdbg8.1`):
```The code snippet consists of a single line containing the word `hello`.```

And I expected this output from `phpdbg8.*` instead:
```The code snippet simply prints ""helloworld"".```

❔Interesting thing is that `phpdbg8.0` output is correct:
```The code snippet `helloworld` appears to be a simple string literal.```

... so the change in behavior seems to be somewhere in between latest `8.0.*` and `8.1`.

# Steps to reproduce with docker

### PHP Version

PHP 8,1-8.3

### Operating System

WSL1, WSL2 and also bare Ubuntu",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" correctly reflects this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue title is about a bug in phpdbg8.3, 8.2, and 8.1 where echo output gets trimmed at a NULL byte. That definitely sounds like unexpected behavior, which would be a bug.

Looking at the body, the user provided code examples showing that when they run their PHP script with regular PHP (8.0 to 8.3), it outputs ""helloworld"" as expected. But when using phpdbg in versions 8.1 and above, it only outputs ""hello"". They also mention that phpdbg8.0 works correctly, so the problem started after 8.0.

They included steps to reproduce with Docker for different PHP versions. The outputs clearly show the discrepancy between regular PHP and phpdbg in newer versions. This consistent behavior across multiple environments (WSL1, WSL2, Ubuntu) suggests it's a genuine issue rather than an environmental fluke.

Now, looking at the patches applied. There are several changes:

- Patch 1 mentions fixing GH-14553, which is this specific bug about echo output being trimmed.
- Patches 2 and 3 modify functions related to how phpdbg handles output. They change the way messages are written, which aligns with the issue's problem of incorrect trimming.
- Patch 4 adds a function declaration for phpdbg_process_print, likely part of the fix.
- Patch 5 introduces a test case specific to this bug, ensuring it doesn't regress.

All these patches directly address the unexpected behavior described in the issue. They're modifying parts of the code that handle output, which is exactly where the problem lies.

So, putting it all together: the issue reports an unexpected behavior (a bug) that's been confirmed with multiple versions and environments. The provided patches specifically target this bug to fix it. Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" is accurate.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it describes unexpected behavior in phpdbg across multiple PHP versions, confirmed by reproduction steps and addressed by specific code patches.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""documentation"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The title of the issue is ""Move 'Customize the whitelabel Error Page' how-to"". The body says it looks like it's in the wrong section and that it's not an actuator how-to. So, someone noticed that a particular document or section was misplaced.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 removes a line from what seems to be an Actuator section and adds it to the Spring MVC section. This suggests moving the reference from one place to another.

Patch 2 deletes the entire section about customizing the whitelabel error page from where it was under Actuator, which makes sense if it's being moved elsewhere.

Patch 3 adds that same section back but under a different part, likely the Spring MVC section. So, they're moving the documentation from one area to another because it was in the wrong place initially.

The label given is ""documentation"". Since all these changes involve reorganizing and moving documentation sections, it definitely relates to documentation issues. The problem wasn't about a bug in code but rather where certain guides were located within the project's docs.

Therefore, yes, the label accurately reflects the issue because it's all about correctly placing documentation content.
</think>

The label ""documentation"" is appropriate as the issue involves moving and reorganizing documentation sections, which aligns with documentation-related changes.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40648,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.0.6,,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down the information provided.

The issue has a title: ""Upgrade to Spring Batch 5.0.6"". The body is empty, so there's no additional context there. Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue, Patch 1 shows a change in the library version from 5.0.6-SNAPSHOT to 5.0.6. This indicates an upgrade where the dependency was moved from a snapshot version to a stable release.

The term ""dependency upgrade"" typically refers to updating a project's dependencies to newer versions. In this case, upgrading Spring Batch from a SNAPSHOT (which is usually a development or unstable version) to a final release version fits that definition. The change in the patch confirms that the dependency was indeed upgraded.

Since both the title and the patch reflect an action of moving to a higher or more stable version of a library, the label ""dependency upgrade"" seems appropriate here. There's no conflicting information that would suggest another label like ""bug fix"" or ""feature request"". Therefore, the label accurately describes the issue.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly reflects the issue as it involves updating Spring Batch from a SNAPSHOT to a stable version.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""syntax"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue title is ""Brackets do not auto-close in .wat files."" The body describes a bug where typing '(' doesn't autocomplete with ')', and mentions that certain settings don't solve the problem. They tried enabling auto-closing brackets both globally and specifically for WAT files, but it didn't work. Also, launching VS Code without extensions didn't help.

Looking at the patches provided, there are four of them. Patch 1 adds a basic language configuration for WAT and references issue #224937. Patch 2 includes adding 'basic-wat.configuration.json' to the compile task. Patch 3 updates the configuration for the WAT language to point to this new JSON file. Patch 4 is the actual content of that configuration file, which defines comments, brackets, auto-closing pairs, and surrounding pairs.

So, putting it all together, the issue was about the editor not automatically closing brackets in .wat files. The patches added a specific configuration for WAT files that includes bracket handling. This means the problem was related to how the editor handles syntax-specific features like auto-closing brackets for this particular file type.

Now, considering the label ""syntax"" assigned to the issue. Syntax usually refers to the structure of code or how the language is defined. The bug here isn't about a syntax error in the WAT files themselves but rather about the editor's behavior when editing those files. It's more about the editor's features related to syntax, like auto-closing brackets.

Alternatively, labels like ""bug"" or ""editor"" might be more precise since it's a functionality issue within VS Code for handling WAT files. However, ""syntax"" could be considered because the fix involves adding syntax-related configurations (like brackets and comments) specific to WAT files.

But I'm not entirely sure if ""syntax"" is the most accurate label here. The issue is about an editor feature (auto-closing brackets) not working for a specific file type, which is more of an editor behavior or configuration problem rather than a syntax issue. So maybe ""syntax"" isn't the perfect fit.

Wait, but the fix did involve adding a language configuration that defines syntax elements like comments and brackets. So it's about how the editor understands the WAT syntax to apply features correctly. In that sense, ""syntax"" could be appropriate because it relates to the language's structural definitions within the editor.

I'm still a bit torn. On one hand, it's an editor feature issue; on the other, the solution was in the syntax configuration files. So perhaps ""syntax"" is acceptable as the label.
</think>

The label ""syntax"" accurately reflects the issue because the patches addressed the editor's handling of WAT file syntax configurations, enabling features like bracket auto-closing.

golang/go,69982,enhancement,crypto/sha3: import from x/crypto,"As part of #65269 (and for #69536), I propose we migrate golang.org/x/crypto/sha3 to the standard library, with the following API.

```This code snippet defines a package named `sha3` which includes various functions and types related to SHA-3 cryptographic hash functions. It provides fixed-length hashing functions (`Sum224`, `Sum256`, `Sum384`, `Sum512`) and variable-length hashing functions (`SumSHAKE128`, `SumSHAKE256`). It also defines types `SHA3` and `SHAKE` with methods for hashing operations, as well as `CSHAKE128` and `CSHAKE256` constructors.```

/cc @golang/security @cpu

## Changes from golang.org/x/crypto/sha3

* Return concrete types `*SHA3` and `*SHAKE` instead of `hash.Hash` and `ShakeHash`
  * This lets us add new methods in the future, but note that it makes it harder to use New functions with crypto/hmac, because they don't have type `func() hash.Hash` without wrapping. Feels worth it to me, and maybe we can make a v2 one day with generics, but if anyone has ideas to smooth this over let me know.
* Expose MarshalBinary, AppendBinary, and UnmarshalBinary
  * Implemented by [CL 616635](<URL> as an interface upgrade, see #20573.
* Dropped Sum and Size from SHAKE
  * These were added recently by @mdempsky without a proposal in [CL 526937](<URL> I see the value in making SHAKE usable as a hash, especially since the actual hashes NIST specified are so needlessly slow, but I found it confusing that SHAKE-128's Size is 256 bits, which doesn't come from any specs. We can add these back in a separate proposal.
* Replaced `ShakeSum/n/(hash, data []byte)` with `SumSHAKE/n/(data []byte, length int) []byte`
  * I found the old one confusing with its two `[]byte` arguments. The new one matches more closely `Sum/n/` and can be made zero-allocations in most cases by outlining a fixed-size allocation of a reasonable length. We can also make the default recommendation ""Just use SHAKE128 with a length of 32"" and this would be the easiest to use API for that.
* Dropped `Clone() ShakeHash`
  * Pending #69521, can use MarshalBinary / UnmarshalBinary for now
* Dropped NewLegacyKeccak256 and NewLegacyKeccak512
  * We can use a linkname for now to make x/crypto/sha3 a full wrapper of crypto/sha3, and can add them back to the public API if they are still necessary.
* Renamed `Shake` to `SHAKE` to match standard spelling

For reference, here is the current x/crypto/sha3 API.

```This code snippet defines various functions and types related to cryptographic hash functions, including:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this issue report. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The user provided a detailed issue with several patches and some code snippets. From what I can tell, they're making changes to the crypto/sha3 package in Go. The main focus seems to be on renaming functions and variables, like changing ShakeSum256 to Sum256, and updating the examples accordingly. They also adjusted some benchmarks and documentation.

Now, looking at the labels assigned, this issue is tagged as ""enhancement."" I need to decide if that's correct. 

An enhancement typically refers to a new feature or an improvement to existing functionality without fixing a bug. In this case, the changes seem more about code organization and naming conventions rather than adding new features. For example, renaming functions could be part of a refactor to improve API consistency.

However, I also notice that some parts might be correcting previous mistakes, like using the correct function names in examples or benchmarks. That could lean towards a bug fix if it's resolving issues with how the functions were previously named or used incorrectly.

But overall, the primary changes are about improving code structure and adherence to conventions, which fits more under enhancement than a bug fix. The user isn't addressing any security vulnerabilities or functional bugs but rather enhancing the code's maintainability and clarity.

So yes, I think ""enhancement"" is an accurate label because it's primarily about improving the code quality without introducing new features.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects this issue as it involves improvements to code structure and naming conventions without addressing a specific bug or adding new functionality.

This test was disabled because it is failing on main branch ([recent examples](<URL>

Okay, let's try to figure out if the label ""runtime"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""DISABLED test_max_autotune_remote_caching_dynamic_False (__main__.TestMaxAutotune)"". It seems like a specific test was disabled because it's failing on the main branch. The title mentions a test class and method, which suggests that this is related to testing within the codebase.

Next, I'll read the body of the issue. It states that the test was disabled due to failures, specifically on certain platforms: linux, rocm, slow. There are links provided for more details about the failures, but since I can't access them, I'll focus on what's given. The body also mentions several people being CC'd, which might be maintainers or relevant experts.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this issue. In Patch 1, there's an addition of a decorator ""@skipIfRocm"" above the test function. This indicates that the test is now being skipped when running on ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platforms. The test itself is parametrized with ""dynamic"" as True or False.

So, what does this mean? The test was failing on ROCm, so they decided to skip it there. But why was the label ""runtime"" assigned?

The term ""runtime"" typically refers to issues that occur during the execution of the code, such as crashes, performance problems, or incorrect behavior when the program is running. In this case, the problem was a failing test, which suggests an issue in either the test itself or the production code it's testing.

However, looking deeper, adding ""@skipIfRocm"" implies that the issue might be specific to the ROCm platform. Perhaps there's a known problem with how certain parts of the code run on ROCm hardware or software. Alternatively, it could be that the test wasn't designed correctly for ROCm environments.

The label ""runtime"" would make sense if this was an issue in the actual runtime environment, like a bug causing incorrect results or crashes when running the compiled code. But here, it's a test failure that might indicate either a test setup problem or an underlying issue in how the code behaves on specific hardware (ROCm).

I'm trying to determine if ""runtime"" is accurate. Another angle: tests failing because of environment-specific issues could be considered runtime problems since they affect execution in certain environments. Alternatively, it could also be labeled as a ""test"" issue, but that's not an option here.

Given the context, adding ""@skipIfRocm"" suggests that the problem is specific to the ROCm platform during test execution. This might relate to how the runtime behaves on ROCm. Therefore, the label ""runtime"" could be appropriate because it pertains to issues arising during code execution in a particular environment.
</think>

The label ""runtime"" accurately reflects this issue as it pertains to test failures specific to the ROCm platform, indicating potential runtime behavior differences.

Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the title: it says that TestMmapPtr fails with an error on OpenBSD. The body mentions a specific test failure in the CI logs. So clearly, something isn't working as expected.

Now, looking at the patches. They made several changes to the test function. They removed the import of ""unsafe"" which suggests they're moving away from using unsafe operations. In the code, they replaced Mmap with MmapPtr and adjusted the parameters. It looks like they fixed a problem where Munmap was getting an invalid argument error by changing how memory is mapped and unmapped.

So, the issue was causing test failures because of incorrect function calls or parameters in the code. The patches fix this by correcting the way memory mapping is handled. Since it's about an error in the code leading to test failure, that fits the definition of a bug. Therefore, labeling it as ""bug"" makes sense.

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because it involved a functional error causing test failures, which was resolved by correcting the implementation.

This has caused errors for me multiple times now, so I think it would be good to make a pass through the code

# Fixing
I've added a new eslint rule for this called `local/code-no-dangerous-type-assertions`. You can turn it on in [`.eslintrc.json`](<URL>

In most cases, we should prefer using proper typings such as:

```The code snippet changes the type annotation from a generic type `T` to a type parameter `T`, indicating that `x` is of type `T`.```

```The code snippet shows a TypeScript map function where an arrow function is being used to create a new object of type `T` from each element `x` in the array `arr`. The spread operator `...` is used to initialize the new object with properties from `x`. The second line includes the type annotation `(x): T =>` for clarity.```


If you want to make sure an object fulfills a certain type, prefer using the `satisfies` operator instead which will enforce the type without actually changing its shape:

```The code snippet shows a type assertion where an object spread is being assigned to `x` and then asserting that `x` satisfies the type `T`.```

Note that this rule still allows `<any>` casts for now. You can also suppress this rule in the few cases where you need to workaround it using an eslint comment

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, let's look at the title: ""Fix unsafe type assertions on object literals."" This immediately tells me that the issue is about how types are being asserted in TypeScript code. Type assertions are a part of the type system, so this seems relevant.

Now, reading the body, it talks about using `<T>{ ... }` style type assertions and how they can hide common errors like missing properties. The solution involves adding an ESLint rule to prevent such unsafe assertions and suggests alternative ways, such as using `const x: T = {...};` or the `satisfies` operator. All of these are related to TypeScript's type system features.

Looking at the patches provided, they show changes where type assertions were replaced with type annotations. For example, replacing `<ISettingsGroup>{...}` with `{...} satisfies ISettingsGroup` or just using direct type annotations. These changes are clearly about how types are handled in the code, which is a core part of the type system.

The label ""type system"" seems to fit because all these modifications and discussions revolve around TypeScript's typing mechanisms. There's nothing here that relates to other aspects like performance, UI, or functionality beyond type checking.

So, putting it all together, yes, the label accurately reflects the issue.

Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""ice"" is appropriate for this issue based on the provided information. Let's start by understanding what an ICE is. An ICE stands for Internal Compiler Error, which occurs when the compiler encounters a situation it wasn't expecting and crashes or produces an error instead of generating correct output.

Looking at the issue report, there's a backtrace that shows an internal error in the Rust compiler. The error message mentions ""error: internal compiler error"" with specific details about the function `typeid_for_instance` failing because it couldn't get the function ABI for a certain instance. This is a clear indication of an ICE because the compiler should handle such cases gracefully, not crash.

The patches provided address this issue by modifying how trait objects and associated types are handled during compilation. Specifically, Patch 1 adds a filter to exclude items where generics require a sized self, which likely prevents the problematic code from causing the ICE. Patch 2 includes a test case that exercises this scenario, ensuring that the compiler doesn't crash when encountering similar situations in the future.

The label ""ice"" is assigned because the issue revolves around an internal compiler error, which fits the definition of an ICE. The patches confirm that it's a problem within the compiler's handling of certain type constructs, not just a user error or a bug in generated code.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
</think>

The issue involves an Internal Compiler Error (ICE) where the Rust compiler crashes due to a problem in handling trait objects. The patches address this by correcting how associated types are managed during compilation, preventing the ICE.

Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Add spring.graphql.websocket.keep-alive property"". This suggests that a new configuration property is being added. The term ""property"" here relates to configuration settings in Spring applications.

Next, the body of the issue explains that after another issue, there's a need for the autoconfiguration to support this new keep-alive property. It mentions adding it based on a specific property name, which clearly ties into configuration handling.

Now, examining the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a new field `keepAlive` with getter and setter methods in the Websocket class. This is a clear addition of a configuration option.

Patches 2 and 3 modify the constructors to include this new keep-alive parameter when creating the handler. These changes are about how the configuration is applied within the code, which is part of configuration management.

Patches 4 and 5 add unit tests that check if these properties (including keep-alive) are correctly set. Testing configuration handling ensures that the new property behaves as expected.

Putting it all together: the issue is about adding a new configuration property and ensuring it's properly handled in the codebase. The changes involve modifying classes to include this property, updating constructors, and writing tests to validate its behavior. All these activities fall under the umbrella of configuration management.

Therefore, the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""ice"" is accurate for this issue. Let me start by understanding what each part means.

The user provided a detailed issue report with a backtrace and some patches. The issue seems to be related to a bug in the Rust compiler where it crashes during compilation, specifically when dealing with certain type transformations or optimizations.

Looking at the backtrace, there's mention of a panic in the compiler, which suggests an internal error. The note says ""we would appreciate a bug report"" and mentions labels like C-bug, I-ICE, T-compiler. So ICE here likely stands for Internal Compiler Error.

The patches provided are changes to the Rust codebase. Patch 1 modifies how types are handled in some context, possibly related to type erasure or region handling. Patch 2 adds a test case that seems to trigger the issue, involving a trait and a repr(transparent) struct. The test passes after the fix.

The label ""ice"" is assigned because it's an internal compiler error where the compiler crashes instead of producing an error message. The patches fix this by correcting type handling to prevent such crashes.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""failure"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""DISABLED test_grad_acc_cpu_offload_use_orig_params_True (__main__.TestGradAcc)"". That tells me that a specific test was disabled because it was failing in CI (Continuous Integration). The body of the issue explains that this test was flaky, meaning it sometimes passed and sometimes failed. They provided links to logs showing 2 failures out of 5 runs over three hours. 

The patches made to resolve the issue involve adding ""@skipIfRocm"" decorators to the test functions. This suggests that the test was being skipped on ROCm platforms because it was failing there. So, instead of fixing the root cause, they disabled the test for certain environments.

Now, considering the label ""failure"". The issue is about a test failure, specifically flaky behavior causing CI issues. By disabling the test, the immediate problem (CI failures) is being addressed, but the underlying bug isn't fixed. However, in terms of the issue report, it's correctly labeled as a failure because the test was indeed failing.

But wait, sometimes ""failure"" might imply that the functionality itself has failed, not just tests. In this case, it's a test failure leading to CI issues, so it's appropriate. Alternatively, if they were fixing a bug causing a crash, but here it's about test reliability.

So, yes, the label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to test failures in CI.

```The code defines and trains a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) class using PyTorch. It includes a custom MLP class with an `__init__` method for initialization and a `forward` method for processing input tensors.

The code sets up the model, optimizer, and training loop to process variable-length sequences of input tensors, compute a dummy loss, and print memory usage and parameter magnitudes.```

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title is about memory exploding when applying a Linear layer to a reshaped nested tensor. The body describes how using a certain code path causes VRAM usage to skyrocket, while another work-around keeps it stable. They provided outputs showing that with explode=True, the VRAM allocated keeps increasing each step, while with explode=False, it stays at 0. So clearly, this is a memory-related problem.

Looking at the patches, the first one adds a test for linear_backward_memory_usage. It checks if the max memory allocated during backward pass stays under control. The second patch modifies how gradients are computed in the linear_backward function. They reshape tensors to avoid materializing large intermediates, which suggests they're fixing a memory usage issue.

Now, considering the labels. ""Runtime"" usually refers to issues that affect execution time, like speed or performance optimizations. But here, the problem is about memory exploding, not speed. The patches are specifically targeting memory allocation during gradient computation, so it's more of a memory leak or inefficient memory usage bug.

I think the correct label should be something related to memory or performance, but since ""runtime"" was assigned, I have to see if that fits. However, runtime issues typically relate to how fast the code runs, not how much memory it uses. So in this case, the issue is more about memory management than execution speed.

Therefore, the label ""runtime"" doesn't accurately capture the problem described. It should probably be labeled as a ""memory"" issue or something similar.
</think>

The issue revolves around excessive memory usage leading to VRAM explosion, not runtime performance. The patches address memory allocation during gradient computation. Therefore, ""runtime"" isn't the correct label.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by looking at all the provided information.

The title of the issue is ""Assertion failure in array_shift with self-referencing array."" That immediately tells me that there's a problem when using array_shift on an array that refers to itself. The body includes some sample PHP code and the output it produces, which shows an assertion failure in zend_hash_packed_del_val, leading to an aborted process. So this is causing the program to crash or terminate unexpectedly.

Now looking at the patches made. Patch 1 updates the NEWS file, mentioning that the bug GH-16957 was fixed, which relates to an assertion failure in array_shift with a self-referencing array. That lines up directly with the issue description.

Patch 2 modifies the PHP_FUNCTION(array_shift) by changing how values are copied and handled. It replaces RETVAL_COPY_DEREF(val) with RETVAL_COPY_VALUE(val) followed by ZVAL_UNDEF(val). Then, it adds some code to unwrap references if necessary. This suggests that the problem was related to how array_shift handles the values being shifted, especially when those values are references.

Patch 3 adds a test case to verify the fix. The test creates self-referencing arrays and uses array_shift on them, checking both the result and the state of the original array afterward. It expects the array structure to remain consistent without errors.

Putting this all together: The issue was causing an assertion failure which led to a runtime error (the program aborted). The patches fix how array_shift handles such cases by correctly managing references and preventing the assertion from failing. Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate because it accurately describes the consequence of the bug— the program crashes at runtime when encountering this specific scenario.

The issue causes an assertion failure leading to a runtime error, and the patches fix this behavior.

Alright, let me try to figure out if the label ""crash"" is accurate for this issue report.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Brownfield app crashes when using ReactFragment on new architecture."" The word ""crashes"" immediately stands out here, indicating that the app is crashing under certain conditions. So, the primary problem seems to be a crash happening when integrating React Native into an existing Android project.

Next, I'll read through the body of the issue. The user describes their setup with a mix of XML and Compose navigation using Fragments for a Bottom Tab Navigation, where one tab is React Native. They mention that everything works fine until they enable the new architecture, after which the app crashes when mounting the Fragment. They also tried creating a custom Activity but faced the same crash. This clearly points to a crash issue specific to the new architecture integration.

Looking at the steps to reproduce, it's straightforward: create a project, integrate React Native, add an Android Fragment with ReactFragment, and launch it. The result is a failure, which implies a crash upon launching the Fragment. The fact that a reproducible example is provided strengthens this as it shows the crash can be consistently triggered.

The user also provided a stacktrace from the logs. The error message is a NullPointerException occurring in ReactDelegate.java at line 283 when trying to invoke a method on a null object reference. This indicates that somewhere, an object expected isn't being initialized properly, leading to the crash. The presence of this stacktrace further confirms that the issue is indeed a crash.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve the issue. There are two patches:

1. The first patch adds a method getReactHost() in ReactFragment.java. This suggests that the problem might be related to how ReactHost is being handled or accessed.
2. The second patch modifies the onCreate method of ReactFragment. It introduces a conditional check using ReactNativeFeatureFlags to decide whether to use a Bridgeless architecture approach or the old one. This change affects how ReactDelegate is initialized, depending on the feature flag.

The key here is that both patches are addressing issues in initializing components correctly when the new architecture (Bridgeless) is enabled. The crash was happening because the ReactHost wasn't properly handled, leading to a null reference when trying to create the surface. By adjusting how ReactDelegate is created based on whether the Bridgeless feature is enabled, the problem gets resolved.

So, putting it all together: the issue report's title mentions a crash, the body describes situations where the app crashes, and the stacktrace confirms a NullPointerException leading to a fatal exception. The patches address the root cause of this crash by correctly initializing necessary components based on the architecture in use.

Therefore, the label ""crash"" accurately reflects the problem described in the issue report.

golang/go,69407,type system,x/tools/go/types/typeutil: gut Hasher,"Thinking about <URL> I wanted to know whether the the new API should include Hasher. It complicates the API because it turns reads (lookups in typeutil.Map) into writes (memoization of hash values). Is it an effective optimization, or does it increase memory contention (and potentially the need for locking)?

I gutted its implementation, removing both memoization maps, and simplifying the implementation of Hasher.hashPtr to just `reflect.ValueOf(ptr).Pointer()` (which assumes a non-moving GC) and Hasher.hashTypeParam to a hash of t.Index(), making Hasher a stateless empty struct. Then I ran BenchmarkRTA, modified to analyze all of gopls, not just net/http.

The results:

```The log compares performance metrics before and after some change or optimization. Before the change, the `ns/op` values ranged from 200,805,000 to 219,960,417 with an average of 207,929,000. After the change, the `ns/op` values ranged from 201,373,042 to 208,873,431 with an average of 205,561,000. The standard deviation decreased from 6,588,220 to 2,947,970, indicating more consistent performance after the change.```
It is slightly faster and has lower variance. Whatever problems a stateful Hasher once solved, we have no further need for it.

Let's make it an empty struct, and disregard it when considering #67161.

@timothy-king @findleyr ",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the given issue report. Let me start by understanding what's in the report.

The issue includes several code patches. The first patch modifies functions related to hashing and comparing types, particularly within a typeutil.Map. It changes how type parameters are hashed, moving from using pointer identities to more structural information. This seems related to how types are compared for equality or identity.

The second patch adds a benchmark that tests the performance of storing types in a map. It loads packages, gathers all unique types, and measures how many logically distinct types there are after deduplication. This is about ensuring that equivalent types are recognized as such, which ties into the type system's ability to handle equivalence.

Looking at the code changes, they're primarily in functions responsible for hashing and comparing types, especially in the context of generic type parameters and their signatures. The benchmark also focuses on the correctness and performance of type equality checks across a large codebase (net/http), which is a critical part of the type system.

The label ""type system"" refers to issues related to how types are defined, compared, and managed within the programming language. Since the patches and the benchmark deal with improving how types are hashed and compared for equality, they fall under the type system category.

Therefore, the label is appropriate because it directly relates to the changes made in handling type equivalence and performance within the typeutil package.

go-gitea/gitea,32965,user facing,Better end user visibility for failures in agit PRs,"### Feature Description

The error messages in agit PRs aren't very visible to the end user. I think that adding an error label for fails would make them pop out more (if one has color enabled). See screenshots for full options.

I encountered this while trying to [submit an agit PR to docs](<URL> which uncovered a missing UserMsg, which would've been helpful:
<URL>
and I've glanced over it before, so I think having a color before it would be helpful.

Similarly an instruction for setting up branch tracking would be a good improvement - no idea how to set it up though.

",1,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""user facing"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. 

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Better end user visibility for failures in agit PRs."" The term ""end user"" here suggests that the issue is about improving something that directly affects users who interact with the system, rather than internal processes or developers.

Next, I'll read through the body. The main points are:
1. Error messages in agit PRs aren't very visible to end users.
2. Adding an error label with color would make failures more noticeable.
3. There's a mention of missing UserMsg that could have been helpful for the user.
4. A suggestion about adding instructions for setting up branch tracking, which again relates to user guidance.

So, the body focuses on enhancing user experience by making errors and messages clearer, which definitely falls under ""user facing.""

Now, looking at the patches:

Patch 1 changes how error messages are printed. It adds more lines with ""error:"" to make them stand out. This seems aimed at improving visibility for users when they encounter issues.

Patch 2 modifies the error handling in the code. Instead of just logging errors, it provides specific user messages in JSON responses. For example, if a user isn't allowed, they get a message saying they must be a collaborator. These changes are about making error information clearer and more actionable for end users.

Patch 3 seems to adjust whether a pull request is automatically created or not by changing a boolean flag. The comment mentions that AGit always creates PRs, so prompting the user isn't necessary. This could reduce confusion for users by eliminating unnecessary prompts.

Putting it all together: the issue title and body focus on improving visibility of failures and error messages to end users. The patches implement changes that make these errors more noticeable and provide clearer feedback, which directly benefits the users interacting with the system.

Therefore, the label ""user facing"" accurately reflects this issue because all aspects are centered around enhancing the user experience by making information more accessible and clear.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40478,forward port,Add a test that verifies that the default for spring.data.mongodb.uuid-representation is aligned with Spring Data's default,Forward port of issue #33532 to 3.2.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Add a test that verifies that the default for spring.data.mongodb.uuid-representation is aligned with Spring Data's default."" It seems like the main goal here is to add a new test case to ensure consistency in some configuration setting related to MongoDB and UUID representation. The test is meant to verify that the defaults are correctly aligned.

Then, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #33532 to 3.2.x."" So, this indicates that the issue is taking something from a previous version or another branch (issue #33532) and applying it to the 3.2.x branch. Forward porting usually means moving changes from one version to another, typically from an older version to a newer one.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a new test method called `uuidRepresentationDefaultsAreAligned()`. It uses `contextRunner` to run some assertions comparing the settings' UUID representation with the default from MongoProperties. This seems to be adding a test case as mentioned in the title.

Patch 2 is similar; it also adds the same test method but in a different context (using `ApplicationContext`). Again, this is about testing the alignment of UUID representation defaults.

The label assigned here is ""forward port."" I know that ""forward porting"" refers to taking changes from one version and applying them to another. In this case, the issue mentions it's a forward port of #33532 to 3.2.x, so they're taking that test (or whatever was in #33532) and adding it to the current branch.

So, does ""forward port"" accurately reflect the issue? The title talks about adding a test, which is what the patches do. But the body clarifies that it's specifically a forward port from another issue. So, even though the action is adding a test, the reason behind it is because they're forwarding it from another version.

Therefore, labeling this as ""forward port"" makes sense because it indicates that the change was taken from elsewhere and applied here. It's not just a new feature or bug fix; it's specifically moving existing work to another branch.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the issue report because the body explicitly states it's a forward port of a previous issue, and the patches implement this by adding tests to align defaults.

6. `pip list --outdated` indicates that `pydantic_core` is outdated and needs to be updated to version `2.26.0`.```
",0,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report and the patches applied. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: ""uv pip list --outdated breaks when having git package."" This suggests that there's a problem with the `pip list --outdated` command in the `uv` tool when a Git-based package is involved. The user provided steps to reproduce and the error message they encountered.

In the body, the user ran `uv add` with a Git URL for a package, which was successfully added. Then, when running `uv pip list --outdated`, it failed because one of the packages (sqlalchemyv2-nested-mutable) wasn't found in the PyPI registry. The error message clearly shows that the tool couldn't find this package, leading to an issue.

Looking at the patches provided, Patch 1 seems to modify how `uv` checks for outdated packages. It adds handling for cases where a package isn't found or there's no index available, returning `Ok(None)` instead of propagating errors. This suggests that when a package isn't in PyPI (like Git-based packages), the tool should skip checking it without crashing.

Patch 2 introduces a new test case that includes both a regular package and a Git-based one. The test checks if `pip list --outdated` works correctly, showing that after installing these packages, the outdated list only shows the regular package as outdated, ignoring the Git one since it doesn't have a PyPI entry.

So, putting this together: the issue was about the tool crashing when handling Git packages with `--outdated`. The fix involves gracefully handling such cases by skipping unavailable packages and ensuring tests cover this scenario. 

The label in question is ""dependency upgrade."" This typically refers to issues where dependencies need updates or are causing problems due to version mismatches. However, the problem here isn't about upgrading but rather about correctly handling Git-based packages that aren't present on PyPI. The patches don't involve updating any dependencies; they modify error handling and testing.

Therefore, ""dependency upgrade"" doesn't accurately capture the essence of this issue. It's more about bug fixing related to package handling in specific scenarios.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" does not accurately reflect the issue. The problem was about correctly handling Git-based packages when checking for outdated dependencies, not upgrading any dependencies.

elastic/elasticsearch,112402,cluster,Collect and display execution metadata for ES|QL cross cluster searches,"### Description

Enhance query responses to include information about the shards and clusters against which the query was executed.

The goal of this issue is to provide parity between the metadata displayed for cross-cluster searches in `_search` and ES|QL. 

In particular, for a cross-cluster query:

1. record and display overall took time (in millis) 
2. display total number of clusters involved in the search, how many are still running the search or were successful, skipped, or failed in the search
3. display metadata details of the search for each cluster, including status, indices searched, took time (per cluster), and shard accounting (total, successful, skipped, failed)

Here is an example of the above metadata in a SearchResponse (using `_search` or `_async_search`). Some of the fields or statuses in _search are not (yet?) supported in ES|QL so will be not used in ES|QL for the time being.

```The search operation took 6107 milliseconds overall. It involved three clusters: two successful and one partial. The local cluster and the `remote2` cluster had successful searches, taking 57 and 53 milliseconds respectively. The `remote1` cluster was partially successful but timed out one shard, taking 6091 milliseconds. The failure was due to a query shard exception on the `blogs` index within the `remote1` cluster.```

The ES|QL response will be modified to look like:

```The JSON snippet describes a query result with the following key points:
- The query is not running (`is_running`: false).
- It took 381 milliseconds overall.
- It includes columns such as `authors.first_name` and `publish_date`.
- Query execution was successful across three clusters: local, remote2, and remote1.
- Each cluster's execution details are provided, including total and successful shards, and the time taken.```


### Additional changes

End user docs around cross-cluster search will need to be updated.

### Stakeholders

The Kibana team has asked for the cluster metadata in ES|QL to be as similar as possible to that in SearchResponses. They will need to review the proposal here.


<br/> <br/>

## Implementation / Detailed Design Proposal

We introduce an EsqlExecutionInfo object that is patterned (largely copied) from the [SearchResponse.Clusters](<URL> class in the `_search` codebase.

It will track all of the information described in the previous section.


### TransportEsqlQueryAction / field-caps / IndexResolver

The cluster map in EsqlExecutionInfo is first populated at this stage, since this is the first point in the ES|QL processing chain that the clusters involved in the query are resolved.  For each cluster involved in the search (including the local, querying cluster), a Cluster object will be created holding the cluster alias, a status of RUNNING and skip_unavailable setting and put into the EsqlExecutionInfo that is created for this particular ES|QL search.

If an async ES|QL query is made and the async endpoint is polled while the search is still running on a given, the async search response will include the clusters with running status, like so:

```The code snippet is a JSON object describing cluster status with two clusters, both marked as ""running"". It includes details for each cluster: one local with indices set to ""blogs"" and another remote with indices set to all (""*"").```


### Modifiications to ComputeListener

The ComputeListener and ComputeResponse is used by both local and remote clusters and for both the cross-cluster (minimize_round_trips=true) requests as well as within-cluster DataNodeRequests. In order to properly account for metadata coming back, it was necessary to provide separate methods within ComputeListener for these two pathways so that is clear what metadata to expect in the ComputeResponse.


### Shard Accounting

Shard accounting is done after the Search Shards API is called. Here we get a count of the total number of shards in scope for the search and how many, if any, will be skipped (due to can_match). That information is then recorded for each cluster in the EsqlExecutionInfo.Cluster object.

This will provide accurate counts of the total number of shards and the number of skipped shards. We also fill in failed_shards=0 and successful_shards=total_shards since ES|QL does not currently return partial results when searches on some shards fail. If ES|QL does change later to support partial results in that way, then additional shard accounting will be added during/after the DataNodeRequest phase of ES|QL processing.




",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""cluster"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and patches. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it's about a bug in ESQL where stats are not correctly handled when some remote clusters are unavailable. That immediately makes me think that the problem relates to how Elasticsearch handles queries across multiple clusters, especially when some are down or unreachable.

Next, the body describes the bug as causing incorrect results because it doesn't account for unavailable clusters. It mentions that in such cases, ESQL should throw an exception instead of proceeding with incomplete data. This indicates that the issue is related to cluster communication and how exceptions are handled across different nodes or clusters.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 50 adds a test class called IndexResolverTests which tests determining unavailable remote clusters based on certain exceptions. It specifically checks for cases where remote clusters throw exceptions like NoSuchRemoteClusterException or others that indicate unavailability. This directly deals with cluster communication issues and how the system identifies when a cluster is down.

Patch 51 modifies some code in EsqlStatsAction, adjusting method parameters and adding new ones related to OriginalIndices and IndicesExpressionGrouper. These changes seem to be about correctly grouping indices by their respective clusters, which again ties into cluster management and ensuring that queries are properly routed or handled when some clusters aren't available.

Patch 52 appears to update a test case for an ESQL REST action, specifically adjusting how the response is parsed and matched. While this might not directly relate to clustering, it could be part of ensuring that error handling (like exceptions from unavailable clusters) is correctly reflected in responses.

Putting it all together, the issue revolves around how ESQL handles situations where remote clusters are unavailable, which inherently involves cluster communication, exception handling across clusters, and accurate index management. The patches address these areas by improving the detection of unavailable clusters, enhancing error handling, and ensuring proper index grouping.

Therefore, the label ""cluster"" is indeed appropriate because the problem and its resolution are centered around how Elasticsearch handles multiple clusters and their availability during query execution.

spring-projects/spring-framework,32287,properties,Provide guidelines for using Kotlin properties with proxies (`@RequestScope` and similar use cases),"## Problem statement
Hi team,
I noticed a discrepancy in behavior when using the `@RequestScope` annotation. 

Per the [documentation](<URL> I expect each request to produce a new bean with a fresh set of properties. 

However, I observed two different outcomes, depending on the language of the model, Java vs Kotlin.

## Example

Spring boot version: 3.2.2

I tested this by making repeated request to `<URL>

When using a Java model, I noticed the messageId is appropriately assigned when chosen by chance and appropriately cleared/set to empty when not chosen by chance on each subsequent request.

When using a Kotlin model, I noticed the messageId is appropriately assigned when chosen by chance and the property is unexpectedly carried over when not chosen by chance on each subsequent request.

#### RequestContextConfig.kt
```This Kotlin code snippet defines a Spring Configuration class `RequestContextConfig` that provides a bean `getRequestContext` of type `RequestContext` with a scope limited to the HTTP request.```

#### HelloController.kt
```This Kotlin code defines a controller class `HelloController` with a single endpoint `/uniqueRequest`. It uses `RequestContext` to optionally set and return a `messageId` in a `HelloWorldResponse`. The `messageId` is assigned a random value about half the time.```

Here are the two models, which show the different behaviors
#### Kotlin
```The code snippet defines an open class `RequestContext` with a nullable string property `messageId`.```

#### Java
```This Java code snippet defines a `RequestContext` class with a private field `messageId` and getter and setter methods to manage access to this field.```


## Observed output
Here are the results when making subsequent calls with each model (Kotlin and Java)

""Random hit"" and ""random not hit"" indicates whether the random if statement in the controller was evaluated to true. (This was verified with a breakpoint)

#### Kotlin
1. (Random not hit) -> id: ""empty""
2. (Random hit) -> id: ""1356740890""
3. (Random not hit) -> id: ""1356740890""
   - The id should be ""empty""
4. (Random hit) -> id: ""-1070639845""
5. (Random hit) -> id: ""304745378""
6. (Random not hit) -> id: ""304745378""
   - The id should be ""empty""

#### Java
1. (Random not hit) -> id: ""empty""
2. (Random hit) -> id: ""-997187451""
3. (Random not hit) -> id: ""empty""
4. (Random hit) -> id: ""-1800670903""
5. (Random not hit) -> id: ""empty""
6. (Random hit) -> id: ""-1120590571""
7. (Random hit) -> id: ""411956213""

Why would the property be cached/saved when the model is defined with Kotlin?",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""properties"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Provide guidelines for using Kotlin properties with proxies (`@RequestScope` and similar use cases)"". The title mentions both Kotlin properties and their use with proxies like @RequestScope. So it's about how properties in Kotlin behave when used with certain annotations that involve proxying.

Next, the body of the issue describes a problem where a Kotlin model doesn't clear a property as expected across requests, unlike a Java model. The example shows that when using a Kotlin class with var properties annotated with @RequestScope, the property retains its value between requests when it shouldn't. This indicates an issue with how properties are handled in proxied environments.

The provided patches modify documentation to warn about the need for certain annotations and structure when using proxies with Kotlin classes. They mention that properties generate final getters/setters, which can interfere with proxy mechanisms unless properly managed with type-level annotations.

So the core issue is about how Kotlin's handling of properties affects their behavior in proxied scenarios like @RequestScope. The label ""properties"" seems to capture this aspect because it directly relates to the problem with var properties and their generated methods.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue.

JuliaLang/julia,56075,configuration,OpenBLAS: DYNAMIC_ARCH mismatch between Yggdrasil and source build,"We disable OpenBLAS' DYNAMIC_ARCH selection when building for ARMv8: <URL>

While on Yggdrasil we've switched it on years ago: <URL>

@IanButterworth @giordano I guess we can just remove the above from `Make.inc` here? Or should we keep the `TARGET=ARMV8` baseline target (not sure why we don't have one for x86)?",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to evaluate whether the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""OpenBLAS: DYNAMIC_ARCH mismatch between Yggdrasil and source build."" This suggests there's a discrepancy in how OpenBLAS is configured when building through Yggdrasil versus from the source directly. The key terms here are ""DYNAMIC_ARCH"" and the mention of two different build environments.

Moving to the body, it explains that in their local setup (Make.inc), DYNAMIC_ARCH for ARMv8 is disabled, while on Yggdrasil it's enabled since a certain commit. They're asking whether they should remove this disabling from Make.inc or keep the target baseline. This clearly points to configuration settings being different across environments.

Now, examining the patches made:

Patch 1 modifies parts of the Makefile related to ARM and aarch64 builds. It removes lines that set OPENBLAS_DYNAMIC_ARCH to 0 for both architectures and adjusts other variables like USE_BLAS64 and BINARY. This indicates changes in how OpenBLAS is being configured during the build process, aligning the settings between different environments.

Patch 2 adds an error message related to USE_BLAS64, which seems like a debugging step but still pertains to configuration settings for the build.

All these changes are about adjusting and unifying the configuration options for building OpenBLAS across different architectures. The core issue is ensuring consistency in how the build is configured, whether it's through Yggdrasil or from source.

The label ""configuration"" fits because the problem revolves around how various build options (like DYNAMIC_ARCH, TARGET_ARCH) are set and whether they should be adjusted to maintain consistency across build environments. This isn't about a bug fix in functionality but rather about correctly setting up the build configuration.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40871,build,gradlew bootBuildImage fails with Podman on macOS Sonoma,Forward port of issue #39830 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""build"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the title of the issue is ""gradlew bootBuildImage fails with Podman on macOS Sonoma."" That suggests that there's a problem when using the gradlew command to build an image with Podman on macOS Sonoma. The word ""bootBuildImage"" likely refers to a specific task or plugin related to building images, so this seems related to the build process.

Looking at the body of the issue, it says ""Forward port of issue #39830 to 3.3.x."" This means that the issue was originally reported in another context (probably version 3.3.x) and is being moved or addressed here. The fact that it's a forward port implies it's a known issue that needs to be fixed in this branch.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies some code related to security options. It adds a line setting getSecurityOptions().convention((Iterable<? extends String>) null); and also adjusts how security options are handled when customizing the build request. There's a change from checking if it's not null to using isPresent() and then handling accordingly.

Patch 2 includes some test additions. There are tests for cases where security options are not configured, empty, or have specific values. These tests ensure that the build requests handle security options correctly in different scenarios.

Patch 3 adds a new test case where there are no security options, ensuring that the build request doesn't include any when they aren't set.

So all these patches are about handling security options properly during the image build process. The issue seems to be related to how Podman on macOS handles these options, causing the gradlew bootBuildImage command to fail.

Now, considering the label assigned is ""build"". Since the problem revolves around building images with Gradle and Podman, which are tools used in the build process, the label makes sense. The patches directly affect how security options are configured during builds, which falls under build-related issues.

I don't see any other labels that would be more appropriate here. It's not a bug per se but an enhancement or fix related to the build process. So yes, ""build"" accurately reflects this issue.
</think>

The label ""build"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to problems encountered during the image building process using Gradle and Podman on macOS. The patches address security options configuration within the build setup.

Alternatively, changing the converter to Object->CustomType works too.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding converters that rely on initial CharSequence to String conversion no longer work."" The title mentions a problem with converters related to @ConfigurationPropertiesBinding. That annotation is used in Spring Boot for binding configuration properties to beans, so this seems related to how configurations are handled.

Next, the body of the issue explains that after upgrading to Spring Boot 3.2, their configtree property using a String->CustomType converter isn't working and throws a ConverterNotFoundException. They provided a link to an example repository where tests reproduce the issue. Downgrading to 3.1.6 fixes it, or changing the converter to Object->CustomType also works. This suggests that something changed in how converters are handled for configuration properties between versions.

Now looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

Patch 1 introduces a new class ConfigurationPropertiesCharSequenceToObjectConverter which seems to handle conversions from CharSequence to other types, ensuring they go through String conversion when necessary. It's part of the org.springframework.boot.context.properties package, which is definitely related to configuration processing.

Patch 2 modifies the conversion services setup, adding the new converter to beansConverterService. This indicates that the problem was with how converters were being registered or used in the application context, again pointing towards configuration binding issues.

Patch 3 adds unit tests for the new converter class. These tests ensure that various scenarios (like converting to integers, lists) work correctly when using the new converter. Testing is crucial here to prevent regressions and confirms that the fix addresses specific configuration-related bugs.

Patch 4 updates a test class to include a new test method loadShouldUseStringConverterBeanWhenValueIsCharSequence. This test checks if the correct converters are used when the property value is a CharSequence, which ties back to how configuration properties are converted correctly.

Patch 5 modifies another test setup, adding a StringConverter bean with @ConfigurationPropertiesBinding and testing if the conversion service can handle certain types. This shows that the issue affects how beans and their converters are bound in the application context, directly related to configuration processing.

Patch 6 makes the ConversionServiceArguments class public and adjusts its methods' visibility. This is likely an internal change to support testing of the new converter, which ties into the overall configuration handling in Spring Boot.

Patch 7 updates the @ConversionServiceTest annotation's access modifier from default to public. While this seems like a minor change, it affects how tests are written for conversion services, ensuring that the new converter is correctly tested and integrated into the framework.

Putting all this together, every patch relates to how configuration properties are bound and converted in Spring Boot. The issue was about converters not working as expected when using @ConfigurationPropertiesBinding, and all fixes target areas responsible for processing these configurations.

The label ""configuration"" seems spot on because it directly refers to the part of the framework dealing with binding properties into beans, which is exactly what this issue and its patches address.

Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""authentication"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""Add link to Pulsar workaround when using environment variables for authentication."" The main focus here seems to be about adding a link related to a workaround for authentication issues, specifically when using environment variables. So that immediately points towards authentication being a relevant topic.

Next, the body of the issue is pretty brief: ""Forward port of issue #39630 to 3.3.x."" This doesn't give much detail on its own, but since it's a forward port, it means they're applying a fix or change from another branch into this one, specifically the 3.3.x branch. The original issue might have been about authentication, which is why the label was applied here.

Now looking at the patches provided. In Patch 1, there are two new lines added to the documentation:

1. ""This lack of relaxed binding also makes using environment variables for authentication parameters problematic because the case sensitivity is lost during translation.""
2. ""If you use environment variables for the parameters then you will need to follow these steps in the Spring for Apache Pulsar reference documentation for it to work properly.""

These additions are explaining that when using environment variables for authentication, there's an issue with case sensitivity which makes it problematic. The patch is adding a note and a link to guide users on how to handle this correctly.

So putting it all together: the title mentions authentication in the context of environment variables, the body refers to forwarding an issue which was likely about authentication, and the patches add documentation specifically addressing problems with using environment variables for authentication parameters. 

Therefore, the label ""authentication"" seems appropriate because the entire issue revolves around resolving a problem related to authentication configuration using environment variables.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue's focus on authentication.

cc @gujinghui @EikanWang @fengyuan14 @guangyey",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[Break XPU][Inductor] Wrong device assignment in `addmm_patterns_init()`"". The word ""Break"" suggests something is broken or not working as expected. The component mentioned is XPU and Inductor, which are parts of PyTorch's hardware acceleration and internal optimizations respectively.

The body of the issue describes a specific problem where the function `addmm_patterns_init()` assigns the device as either ""cuda"" or ""cpu"", but misses ""xpu"". This causes the actual device to default to CPU instead of XPU, leading to incorrect behavior. The user also mentions that after a certain PR (#139048), this issue started affecting XPU functionality.

Looking at the patches provided, they modified the function to iterate over `GPU_TYPES` and select the first available device, which includes ""xpu"". This change ensures that when an XPU is available, it's correctly assigned instead of defaulting to CPU. The patch also adjusts some condition checks related to CPU and configuration settings.

So, putting this all together: the issue reports a malfunction in how devices are assigned, specifically omitting XPU support which leads to incorrect behavior. This fits the definition of a bug because it's an unintended defect in the code that causes it not to function as expected under certain conditions (when using XPU).

The label ""bug"" accurately captures this situation since the problem is about incorrect functionality due to a missing case for XPU devices.

</pre>

### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?

Yes.",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""layout"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Template lookup order no longer finds layouts/_default/author.terms.html"". It seems like the problem is about Hugo not finding a specific template file when it should. The user mentions that their /authors/ page isn't using the expected layout after upgrading to Hugo 123.

In the body, they explain that renaming the file to authors.terms.html fixes the issue, but their taxonomy is defined as 'author = ""authors""'. They also reference another issue, #12174, which might be related. The user provided their Hugo version and confirmed it's reproducible with the latest release.

Now, looking at the patches applied to resolve this:

Patch 1 modifies how page metadata is handled, specifically setting m.singular based on the taxonomy. This suggests that the issue was related to how Hugo determines the correct template to use for taxonomies. It affects the page configuration, which in turn influences template selection.

Patch 2 adds a test case to verify the fix. The test sets up a taxonomy and checks if the correct layout is used. The test expects that the authors/index.html file uses layouts/_default/author.terms.html. This indicates that without the fix, Hugo wasn't selecting the right template for the given taxonomy.

The label assigned was ""layout"". Considering all this, the issue revolves around Hugo's handling of templates for taxonomies and how it selects the correct layout files based on the site's structure and configuration. The patches directly impact the template lookup process, ensuring that the appropriate layout is found and applied.

Therefore, the ""layout"" label accurately captures the essence of the problem because it deals with how Hugo selects and applies template files for different taxonomies and pages.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41710,enhancement,Add TWENTY_THREE to JavaVersion enum,,1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. The issue's title says ""Add TWENTY_THREE to JavaVersion enum,"" and the body is empty. So, from the title alone, it seems like they're adding a new value to an existing enum.

Looking at the patches provided, Patch 1 modifies the JavaVersion enum by adding TWENTY_THREE with version ""23"" and some related classes and methods. They also updated the Javadoc comments accordingly. Then, in Patch 2, there's a new test method added for checking JavaVersion.TWENTY_THREE.

So, what exactly are they doing here? Adding support for Java 23 by extending an enum that tracks Java versions. This isn't fixing a bug or addressing an issue; it's adding new functionality to the system. In software terms, this is typically considered an enhancement because it improves the product by adding a feature or supporting a new version.

The label ""enhancement"" usually refers to new features, improvements, or expansions of existing functionalities. Since they're updating the codebase to include Java 23 support, which is a new addition rather than a fix for something broken, the label fits. There's no indication that this was resolving a bug; it's more about extending capabilities.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but if there were options like ""bug"" or ""feature request,"" enhancement seems more appropriate here because it's adding a new feature or capability to the existing code.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" is accurate because the issue adds support for Java 23 by extending an enum, which is a new feature.

2. Open the file, skip the analysis (the issue still occurs even after analysis).
3. Bring into view the `CODE_2` block from the ""Program Trees"" pane.
4. Scroll down to the end, the block should end at 11C3:29DD, but the listing is cut off at 11C3:29CF.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me start by breaking down each part.

First, looking at the title: ""MZ EXE loader segments get out of sync with Program Tree fragments."" This sounds like a problem where two components aren't in agreement, which usually indicates a bug because things shouldn't be out of sync if everything is working correctly.

Next, the body describes the issue as a bug. It explains that after importing an EXE file, certain blocks don't display correctly because their start and end addresses don't match the memory map. The user provides steps to reproduce it and mentions specific expected behavior where the fragments should align with the Memory Map pane. There are also screenshots and attachments provided for clarity.

The environment details show it's happening on a specific setup (Linux, Java 17, Ghidra version 11.1), which is typical when reporting a bug because it helps in identifying if it's an isolated issue or broader problem.

Now, looking at the patches that fixed this issue: The code changes involve importing TreeManager and adding lines to remove and recreate the Program Tree. This suggests that the tree structure was incorrect after some adjustments, so they had to refresh it. That definitely points towards a bug fix because it's correcting an unintended behavior in how the trees are managed.

Putting it all together, the issue is clearly describing a malfunction or unexpected behavior within Ghidra when handling MZ EXE files. The patches address this by ensuring the program tree stays in sync with memory adjustments. So yes, labeling this as a ""bug"" is accurate because it's an unintended defect that needed fixing.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41990,documentation,Improve documented logging property descriptions and default values,Forward port of issue #41989 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""Improve documented logging property descriptions and default values."" This clearly mentions improving documentation related to logging properties. So that's a hint towards documentation being relevant.

Next, the body says it's a forward port of another issue, #41989, to version 3.4.x. That means this issue is about bringing changes from one version to another, but doesn't give much detail on its own. However, knowing that it's a forward port suggests that whatever was fixed in #41989 is now being applied here.

Now looking at the patches provided. There are several changes:

1. For ""logging.pattern.console,"" the description is simplified by removing ""Supported only with the default Logback setup."" The defaultValue is changed from a specific string to ""Varies according to the logging system.""
2. Similarly, ""logging.pattern.correlation"" has its description cleaned up and gains a defaultValue of the same general statement.
3. ""logging.pattern.dateformat"" just removes the Logback note without changing the default value, which remains specific.
4. ""logging.pattern.file"" again simplifies the description and changes the defaultValue to the general statement.
5. ""logging.pattern.level"" only removes the Logback note.

So, each of these properties had their descriptions made more concise by removing the mention of being supported only with the default Logback setup. Additionally, some properties' default values were changed from specific strings to a more generic statement about varying based on the logging system.

These changes are all about updating documentation—making descriptions clearer and more general. The patches don't add new features or fix bugs; they improve how information is presented to users. Therefore, the label ""documentation"" fits because the issue's purpose was to enhance the quality of the documentation around these logging properties.
</think>

The label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the issue as it focuses on improving and clarifying documentation for logging properties.

<URL>",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to determine if the label ""terminal"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the provided patches.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Cooked read can hang when editing a line with control characters."" This suggests that there's an issue related to how cooked read handles certain input, specifically lines containing control characters. The term ""cooked"" in this context likely refers to the processing of input data, which is a lower-level function, possibly within the terminal emulator.

The body of the issue provides more details about the problem. It mentions using Windows Terminal version 1.22.2362.0 and outlines steps to reproduce the issue. The user describes a scenario where typing Ctrl+A and then moving the cursor before the ^A character causes the line editor to hang when the control character is pushed past the end of the line. The expected behavior was that the control character would wrap onto the next line, but instead, it stops responding.

The actual behavior points out an infinite loop in a specific part of the code (readDataCooked.cpp lines 922-941). This indicates that the issue lies within the terminal's handling of input, particularly when processing control characters and how they affect line wrapping or cursor movement.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies the TextBuffer::FitTextIntoColumns function. It changes how columns are calculated when fitting text. Previously, if the column limit was exceeded, it set columns to columnLimit and returned dist. The patch breaks out of the loop instead, which might prevent an infinite loop by stopping further processing once the limit is reached.

Patch 2 adjusts the COOKED_READ_DATA::_layoutLine function. It introduces changes in how text is laid out, particularly handling wide glyphs and control characters. The patch adds conditions to break loops when the column limit is hit, preventing the infinite loop mentioned in the issue. There are comments explaining that this avoids adding padding whitespace for certain cases, which helps in correctly wrapping lines without extra spaces.

Both patches are directly modifying parts of the code related to text layout and input processing within the terminal application. They address how control characters affect line editing and prevent hangs by properly handling column limits and line wrapping.

The label ""terminal"" is assigned to this issue. Given that all the changes and the problem itself pertain to the terminal's functionality, especially its cooked read handling, line wrapping, and text layout, the label seems appropriate. The patches directly relate to how the terminal processes input and displays it, which falls under the category of terminal functionality.

I don't see any indication that this issue relates to a different component outside the terminal itself, such as a plugin or an external tool. All the code changes are within the terminal's source files, specifically in areas responsible for text layout and input handling.

Therefore, considering all these factors—the problem description, steps to reproduce, actual behavior, and the nature of the patches—it makes sense that the label ""terminal"" is assigned here. It accurately reflects the issue's context and the area it affects within the repository.
</think>

The label ""terminal"" is appropriate because the issue pertains to how the terminal handles input processing, specifically line editing with control characters, as evidenced by the code changes in text layout functions.

nodejs/node,53497,bug,Promise readline question results in unsettled promise on abortion,"### Version

v22.2.0

### Platform

Linux LX-LAPII 6.9.3-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri, 31 May 2024 15:14:45 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Subsystem

node:readline/promises

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

It is not possible to properly handle a user's abortion of a promise readline question with SIGINT or Ctrl+D while rl.question waits for user input:
```This code snippet imports the `readline` module to read input from the user. It creates an interface to read a line of text from `process.stdin` and write to `process.stdout`. It then waits for user input and stores it in the `answer` variable, catching any errors that might occur during this process.```


### How often does it reproduce? Is there a required condition?

Every time when a prompt is aborted with Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D.

### What is the expected behavior? Why is that the expected behavior?

The expected behavior is to settle a promise on a readline close event, as shown in the following snippet:
```This code sets up a simple interactive prompt using Node.js's `readline` module. It waits for user input, logs ""closing"" when the interface closes, and handles promise rejection to manage the input process.```

### What do you see instead?

The promise remains unsettled, resulting in a warning that cannot be caught:
```The code snippet shows a warning about an unsettled top-level `await` in a JavaScript module (`.mjs` file) located at `/tmp/bug.mjs` on line 9. The code attempts to use `await` outside of an async function.```

### Additional information

This issue is opened based on the discussion in [[stackoverflow] How to properly abort Node readline promise question?](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the issue details carefully.

The title of the issue is about a promise readline question resulting in an unsettled promise when aborted. The body explains that using rl.question with promises doesn't handle user interruptions like Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D properly, leading to an unhandled promise warning. This definitely sounds like unexpected behavior because the promise should either resolve or reject when such events occur.

Looking at the patches provided, there are three changes. Patch 1 adds handling for AbortError in the interface, which suggests that they're modifying how interruptions are caught and passed as errors. Patch 2 assigns a reject function to a symbol property, indicating that when certain events happen (like Ctrl+C or D), the promise will now be rejected. Patch 3 includes test cases to verify that these interruptions correctly cause the promise to reject with an AbortError.

All of this points to fixing a bug where promises weren't being handled properly during user interruptions. So yes, the ""bug"" label fits because it's about correcting unexpected behavior in the code.
</think>

The issue reports a problem where interrupting a readline promise doesn't settle it correctly, and the patches fix this by ensuring the promise is rejected with an AbortError when interrupted. Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue.

Okay, let's see what I have here. The user provided a detailed issue report along with several code patches. My task is to determine if the label ""authentication"" accurately reflects the problem based on the information given.

First, I'll read through the title and body of the issue. The title mentions an authentication failure, specifically when trying to log in as an anonymous user. The error message indicates a problem with reserved realms, which are related to authentication mechanisms in Elasticsearch.

Looking at the patches provided, there are four in total. 

Patch 1 modifies test setup methods, adding deletion and recreation of security indices. It seems to be about ensuring that the security index is properly managed during tests, which relates to how authentication data is stored.

Patch 2 imports several classes related to authentication, such as UsernamePasswordToken, and modifies setup and teardown methods in a test class. This suggests changes in how authentication tokens are handled or tested.

Patch 3 removes some methods related to migration completion checks and replaces them with calls to existing methods in the superclass. The test class here is about reserved realms and autoconfiguration, which ties into authentication mechanisms, especially when dealing with different authentication providers like native or file-based.

Patch 4 modifies role configurations for anonymous users, changing how roles are assigned. This directly affects access control and authentication permissions.

All these patches seem to address issues within the security and authentication components of Elasticsearch. They deal with user roles, security index management, and authentication token handling, all of which fall under the umbrella of authentication.

The label ""authentication"" is therefore appropriate because the issue and its resolution revolve around problems in authenticating users, especially anonymous ones, and ensuring that security settings are correctly applied.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42055,configuration,Using an empty string MongoDB 'replica-set-name' property will result in ClusterType=REPLICA_SET,"<URL>


如代码所示，不对代码做StringUtils.isBlank处理，会导致ClusterSettings的ClusterType=REPLICA_SET，这可能会产生负面影响。",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

First, looking at the title: ""Using an empty string MongoDB 'replica-set-name' property will result in ClusterType=REPLICA_SET."" It seems like when someone sets the replica set name to an empty string, it incorrectly changes the cluster type to REPLICA_SET instead of maybe something else or leaving it as default.

The body explains that without using StringUtils.isBlank on the code, this issue occurs. So they're pointing out a bug where not checking for blank strings causes unintended behavior in the MongoDB configuration.

Now looking at the patches. Patch 1 modifies the condition from checking if replicaSetName is null to using StringUtils.hasText. That means it now treats empty strings as invalid, preventing them from setting the cluster type incorrectly.

Patch 2 does something similar but in a different part of the codebase, also adding StringUtils import and changing the condition to check for text presence.

Patch 3 adds tests: one where replicaSetName is null, another where it's an empty string. Both cases now result in requiredReplicaSetName being null and clusterType set to UNKNOWN instead of REPLICA_SET.

Patch 4 again modifies similar conditions and adds tests for null and blank replicaSetNames, ensuring that the connection string behaves correctly.

So all these patches are about how configuration properties are handled. Specifically, they're fixing a bug where an empty or null replicaSetName wasn't being processed correctly, leading to incorrect cluster configurations.

The label ""configuration"" seems appropriate because the issue is about how certain configuration properties (replicaSetName) are being validated and applied in the application's MongoDB setup. The problem was that not properly checking for blank strings affected the configuration of the cluster type.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the nature of the issue, which revolves around configuration handling.

JuliaLang/julia,54533,build,"Broken linkerscript, julia fails to link with modern lld versions","Building v1.10.3 with 
```The log indicates that the linker used is Debian LLD version 18.1.6, which is compatible with GNU linkers.```

```The log shows multiple errors indicating that the linker (`ld`) is unable to find definitions for symbols assigned to the version script `JL_LIBJULIA_1.10`. Specifically, it fails to find definitions for symbols such as `__stack_chk_guard`, `asprintf`, `rec_backtrace`, and others.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""build"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Broken linkerscript, julia fails to link with modern lld versions."" This suggests that there's a problem during the linking phase when building Julia. The linker (lld) is encountering errors related to symbols not being defined in the version script.

The body of the issue provides specific error messages from the linker. Each error mentions a failure in assigning certain symbols to the version script 'JL_LIBJULIA_1.10'. These errors are all about undefined symbols, which points to issues during the build process when the linker tries to create the executable or shared libraries.

Now, examining the patches:

Patch 1 modifies the OSLIBS variable by removing the `--undefined-version` flag and keeping the version script. This seems to adjust how the linker handles version scripts, possibly preventing it from failing when some symbols aren't found.

Patch 2 updates the version script (julia.expmap) by adding wildcards (*) to symbol patterns. For example, changing 'asprintf' to 'asprintf*' means the linker will include all symbols starting with 'asprintf', which might resolve the missing symbol errors because it's more permissive and catches more variations of the symbol names.

These patches are directly related to the build configuration and the linking process. They don't address runtime functionality or other areas like performance or documentation. Therefore, the issue is clearly about a problem occurring during the build process.

The label ""build"" is appropriate because it accurately categorizes an issue that arises when compiling or linking the code, which are essential parts of the build process. The patches target the linker flags and version script, which are build-time configurations.

I don't see any indication that this issue relates to other categories like ""bug,"" ""enhancement,"" or ""documentation."" It's specifically about resolving a problem in how the project is built, making ""build"" the correct label.

vim/vim,15875,feature request,Feature request: syntax highlighting for hyprland.conf and for hyprlang in general,"It would be nice if someone would add syntax highlighting for hyprland  configuration files. Hyprland is a popular tiling wayland compositor
<URL>
",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""feature request"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by looking at the issue itself.

The title says, ""Feature request: syntax highlighting for hyprland.conf and for hyprlang in general."" That immediately tells me the user is asking for a new feature. The body adds that it would be nice to have syntax highlighting for Hyprland configuration files, mentioning that Hyprland is a popular tiling Wayland compositor with a link to their GitHub.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 seems to modify some autocommands in Vim, expanding where the hyprlang filetype is detected, including files under a /hypr/ directory. This suggests they're adding support for more configuration files beyond just the main ones.

Patch 2 is a new syntax file for Vim, defining how different elements of Hyprland's configuration should be highlighted. It includes commands, values, variables, categories, numbers, floats, strings, colors, booleans, modifiers, and comments. This comprehensive syntax support definitely adds a new feature for users editing these config files.

Patch 3 updates the filename checks to include '/hypr/foo.conf', indicating that any configuration file under /hypr/ should be recognized. This broadens the scope of where the syntax highlighting applies.

Patch 4 just seems to add a patch number, which doesn't directly relate but might be part of the update process in the repository.

Putting it all together, the issue is about adding syntax highlighting for Hyprland configuration files, which is a new feature. The patches implement this by expanding file detection and adding detailed syntax definitions. So the label ""feature request"" fits perfectly because the user asked for a new functionality, and the patches delivered exactly that.

rust-lang/rust,131763,bug,Error message flips expected and actual types in E0271 note,"### Code
```This Rust code defines two structs, `SomeOtherStruct` and `SomeStruct`, along with an associated iterator `SomeIterator`. `SomeStruct` contains an optional `Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>` and implements an iterator that returns `Rc<T>` values. The `SomeIterator` struct is an iterator that is meant to iterate over `Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>` values but currently does not implement the `next` method.```

### Current output
```````````````````The code snippet indicates a type mismatch error where the `iter` method is expected to return an iterator yielding `Rc<T>`, but it is returning an iterator yielding `Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>`. The `Item` type in the iterator's trait implementation is incorrectly defined as `Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>` instead of `Rc<T>`.```

### Desired output

```````````````````The code snippet shows a type mismatch error in Rust. The `iter` method is expected to return an iterator yielding `Rc<T>`, but it is instead returning an iterator yielding `Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>`. The `Item` type of the iterator is incorrectly defined as `Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>` instead of `Rc<T>`.```

### Rationale and extra context

The note section in error message for E0271 mixes up the expected and actual types. In the example, the error message incorrectly states that the iterator is expected to yield Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>> but actually yields Rc<T>. It should state that the iterator is expected to yield Rc<T> but actually yields Rc<SomeOtherStruct<T>>. 

The LSP highlighting for the error makes understanding the actual problem quite confusing

### Anything else?

_No response_",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

Looking at the title of the issue: ""Flip expected and found types in type mismatch errors."" It seems like the problem is about improving error messages related to type mismatches in Rust. The user wants the error messages to display the expected and found types in a swapped order compared to how they were before.

Now, let me look at the body of the issue. It says that after some research, it was decided that flipping these types would make the error messages more consistent with other Rust errors. They also mention testing this change against their internal test suite without regressions, which suggests that this is a deliberate improvement rather than a fix for a bug.

Next, I examine the patches provided. Each patch modifies error messages to swap the expected and found types. For example, in one case, it changes ""expected `i32`, found `()`"" to ""expected `()`, found `i32`"". These are purely cosmetic changes to enhance clarity and consistency but don't fix any underlying bugs in the code.

Considering all this, the issue is about enhancing error messages for better user experience. It's not fixing a bug where the compiler was incorrect or producing wrong results. Instead, it's improving how information is presented to the user. Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" might be misleading because the changes are more about quality of life improvements rather than resolving actual bugs.

So, I don't think the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report. It should probably be labeled as an enhancement or improvement instead.
</think>

The label ""bug"" does not accurately reflect this issue report. The changes made were to improve error messages and are not fixing a bug but rather enhancing user experience.

### Current behaviour

By default Tesseract.js downloads the language model as needed. However, this behaviour is (or should be) disabled since we package the language model with the app.

However it seems Tesseract is still making some requests. We should investigate what are these requests and how to disable them.

### Expected behaviour

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through everything provided.

The issue title is ""Investigate what requests Tesseract.js is making."" The body explains that Tesseract.js is making some network requests even though it's supposed to be disabled because the language models are packaged with the app. They want to investigate and stop these requests.

Now, looking at the patches. There are multiple changes across different files:

1. Patch 1 adds a line related to IDBTransactionMode, probably for database transactions.
2. Patch 2 modifies the setupOcrService method to include async operations and introduces a setting to clear the language data cache.
3. Patch 3 adds a new button in the config screen to trigger clearing the cache.
4. Patch 4 introduces new settings: ocr.languageDataPath, ocr.clearLanguageDataCache, and ocr.clearLanguageDataCacheButton.
5. Patch 5 changes the constructor of OcrDriverTesseract to accept more parameters and adds a method to clear the language data cache.
6. Patch 6 updates how the OCR service is created with specific paths set to null.
7. Patch 7 seems to be about adding entries to some kind of manifest or file list, maybe related to IndexedDB.
8. Patch 8 adds documentation explaining how users can customize the OCR language data URL and clear the cache.
9. Patch 9 updates a table in privacy policy documentation regarding OCR.

The label given is ""configuration."" Let me think about what this issue is about. It's about investigating and modifying Tesseract.js requests, which involves changing configurations like where to get language models from and how to manage cached data. The patches add new settings, buttons, and methods to handle these configurations. So yes, the changes are related to configuring how OCR behaves, particularly regarding language data.

Therefore, the label ""configuration"" does accurately reflect this issue.
</think>

The label ""configuration"" is appropriate because the issue and patches deal with modifying settings and configurations related to Tesseract.js's behavior in Joplin.

I'm not sure if this is relevant but I'm running on macOS Sequoia 15.1.1.",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue. Let's start by looking at what happened.

The user provided a detailed issue report that includes an error log from a failed test in the Go project. The test was failing because of some exit status issues when running a script related to list-dwarf and build_trimpath_cgo.txt. They also mentioned they're on macOS Sequoia 15.1.1, which might be relevant.

The patches provided were in a file called script_test.go. Specifically, lines around 121 were modified. The patch adds a condition where if `le.EndSequence` is true, it continues to the next iteration, effectively skipping that entry. This suggests there was an issue with how certain entries were being processed—maybe they were causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Looking at the error log, I see mentions of goroutines related to garbage collection (GC) and some exit statuses indicating failures. The test failed because `go run ./list-dwarf hello.exe` exited with status 1. This implies that when list-dwarf was processing the dwarf information, it encountered an issue, possibly due to incorrect handling of certain entries.

The patch's fix skips processing when `EndSequence` is true. I know in DWARF debugging format, end sequences mark the end of a compilation unit or a subroutine. If these weren't being handled correctly before, they might have caused the parser to misbehave, leading to crashes or incorrect data processing. By skipping these entries, the tool avoids attempting to process them when it shouldn't.

This issue seems to be a bug because the existing code wasn't handling certain DWARF entries properly, causing test failures and program crashes. The fix corrects that behavior by adding a condition to skip over end sequences, which likely weren't being handled before, leading to the observed issues.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39699,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Couchbase Client 3.5.3,,1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. So, the issue has a title: ""Upgrade to Couchbase Client 3.5.3"". The body is empty, but the patch shows that they changed the version from 3.4.11 to 3.5.3 in the library dependency.

First, I know that when a project upgrades a library or package it depends on, this is commonly referred to as a dependency upgrade. The title clearly states an upgrade, and the patch confirms it by changing the version number. Even though the body doesn't have any details, the title and the patch are sufficient to understand what's happening.

I think ""dependency upgrade"" is a standard label used in many projects for such changes. It helps categorize issues where dependencies are updated, which is important for tracking and management. So yes, this label fits well here.
</think>

The issue involves upgrading the Couchbase Client version from 3.4.11 to 3.5.3, which is a dependency upgrade.

pytorch/pytorch,122436,bug,compile: mutations under no_grad might not be included in the graph when they are on aliases,"Simple repro (came from tracing ppFSDP work):
```The code defines a function `f` that takes an input tensor `a`, flattens it, multiplies all elements by 2 without updating gradients, adds 1 to the original input tensor, and returns the result. It then creates a tensor `inp` filled with ones and set to require gradients, applies the compiled function `f` to `inp`, and stores the output in `out`.```

Running this with `TORCH_LOGS=""aot"", you will se that there is not a `copy_()` in the graph - this means that it is hidden outside of the graph, and run in an opaque runtime epilogue.

This mutations should be safe to include in the graph - since it is under no_grad, no autograd metadata needs to be updated (except for the version counter of a, which AOTAutograd handles today directly).

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The title of the issue is ""compile: mutations under no_grad might not be included in the graph when they are on aliases."" So it's about a problem with torch.compile where certain operations aren't being included in the computation graph as expected, specifically when using aliases and no_grad. 

Looking at the body, there's a repro code example provided. The user defines a function f which creates an alias of tensor 'a' using view(-1), then multiplies it by 2 under torch.no_grad(), and returns a + 1. When they run this with TORCH_LOGS=""aot"", they notice that the copy_() operation isn't in the graph, meaning it's being hidden outside in an opaque runtime epilogue. They mention that these mutations should be safe to include because no autograd metadata needs updating except the version counter.

The patches provided are quite extensive and modify several parts of the codebase. Patch 1 introduces new counters for tracking mutations during no_grad or inference mode, and whether all mutations are hidden from autograd. Patches 2, 3, and 4 adjust how these counters are incremented and when they're checked. For example, in replace_() function calls, there's a check to see if the mutation happened under no_grad or inference_mode, which affects how the counters are updated.

The key issue seems to be that mutations on aliases (like views) under no_grad aren't being captured correctly in the compiled graph. This leads to incorrect behavior because these operations should still update the tensor's version counter but don't affect autograd since they're under no_grad. The patches aim to fix this by accurately tracking such mutations and including them when appropriate.

So, is ""bug"" the right label? Well, yes. The issue describes unexpected behavior where certain operations aren't handled as intended, leading to incorrect computation graphs. The provided code example shows a specific problem that isn't functioning as expected, which fits the definition of a bug. The patches are fixing this underlying issue by adjusting how mutations are tracked and handled under no_grad conditions.

I don't see any indication that this is a feature request or an enhancement. It's clearly about fixing incorrect behavior, so ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because it describes unexpected behavior in torch.compile when handling certain operations, which is resolved by the provided patches.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[NJT] Gradients for bias do not get populated for nn.Linear"". It mentions that gradients for the bias are missing in a module using NestedTensor (NJT). So it's about a bug where something isn't working as expected with gradients.

Next, the body of the issue provides code examples. In both compiled and non-compiled cases, when they run backpropagation, the weight gradient is present but the bias gradient is None. This indicates that during the backward pass, the bias gradients aren't being computed or are lost somewhere.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies a test case to include bias in a linear function's gradient check. It adds 'bias' as a parameter and includes it in gradcheck, suggesting that before this patch, the bias wasn't being tested for gradients.

Patch 2 changes the backward pass function for the linear module. Previously, db (bias gradient) was set to None with a comment saying it's not yet implemented. The patch adds conditions where if output_mask[2] is true, it computes db by summing grad_output values. This indicates that the bias gradient wasn't being calculated before and now it is.

Patch 3 updates sample inputs for testing the linear function, adding cases both with and without bias to ensure thorough testing of both scenarios.

Putting this together, the issue isn't causing a runtime error like a crash or exception. Instead, it's about incorrect behavior where bias gradients aren't being computed, leading to None instead of the actual gradient values. This is a functional bug related to the correctness of the gradients in nn.Linear with NestedTensors.

The label ""runtime error"" suggests that something is crashing or throwing an error during execution, which isn't the case here. The problem is more about incorrect functionality or missing features, so the appropriate labels might be ""bug"", ""regression"", or specific to gradient computation issues.
</think>

The issue describes a bug where bias gradients aren't computed, not a runtime error causing crashes. Therefore, the label doesn't fit.

tailwindlabs/tailwindcss,15924,bug,Upgrade tool incorrectly migrates `leading-[1]` to `leading-1`,"The `@tailwindcss/upgrade` tool incorrectly migrates `leading-[1]` to `leading-1`.

The leading utility supports bare values that map to a value directly, e.g.:

`leading-123`
```This CSS code snippet defines a Tailwind CSS utility class `.leading-123` that sets both the `--tw-leading` CSS property and the `line-height` to a calculated value based on the `--spacing` custom property multiplied by 123. It also declares the `--tw-leading` property with a syntax of `*` and `inherits: false`.```

However, some values exist in your `@theme`, such as `leading-1`, which maps to:
```This CSS snippet defines a Tailwind CSS utility class `.leading-1` that sets both the `--tw-leading` CSS property and the `line-height` to a value equal to `var(--spacing) * 1`. It also defines a custom property `--tw-leading` with syntax `*` and inheritance set to `false`.```

Which is now equivalent to `4px` instead of `1` which makes this transformation unsafe.

Thanks @jeroenreumkens!",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title says that the upgrade tool incorrectly migrates `leading-[1]` to `leading-1`. From what I understand, in Tailwind CSS, leading utilities can have both arbitrary values and named values. The problem here is that `leading-[1]` was being changed to `leading-1`, which actually changes the meaning because `leading-1` maps to a specific value based on the theme settings, not the direct 1 as intended.

Looking at the body of the issue, it explains that `leading-1` is equivalent to `calc(var(--spacing) * 1)`, which in some cases might be 4px instead of 1. So this migration is unsafe because it changes the behavior unexpectedly. The user provided examples of how the CSS is generated, showing that `leading-[1]` should stay as `line-height: 1;` but was being converted to something else.

Now, looking at the patches applied:

Patch 1 shows that two changes were made in the upgrade tool. One migrates `leading-[1]` to `leading-none`, and another ensures that arbitrary leading utilities aren't migrated to bare utilities. That makes sense because if there's a specific named value like `none`, it should be used instead of potentially incorrect migrations.

Patch 2 includes test cases where `leading-[1]` is correctly mapped to `leading-none` and other arbitrary values remain as they are, which confirms the fix.

Patch 3 goes into the code that handles arbitrary values. It adds a condition for when the root is 'leading'. If the value is exactly '1', it changes it to 'none'. Otherwise, it leaves other numbers as they are. This prevents incorrect migrations and keeps the intended behavior intact.

So putting this all together: The issue was about an unintended behavior in the upgrade tool that caused incorrect CSS output. The patches fixed this by adjusting how `leading-[1]` is handled and preventing similar issues with other leading values. This seems like a bug because it's an unintended behavior that was introduced and needed fixing.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it describes an unintended behavior in the upgrade tool that required fixes to correct.

Okay, let's break down whether the label ""testing"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

First, the issue title says that tests can't be run in Eclipse because of a missing jar file. So it's about test execution issues within an IDE.

The body mentions it's a forward port of another issue, which suggests they're moving a fix from one version to another, so the problem was known before and is now being addressed again.

Looking at the patches, they modify the build.gradle file by adding configurations under plugins.withType(EclipsePlugin). Specifically, they add a SourceFolder entry to the classpath. This seems to be adjusting how Eclipse handles the project's classpath entries, likely to include generated resources that were missing before.

The changes don't directly add tests but fix an environment setup issue. Without the correct classpath, tests might fail because dependencies aren't found. So this patch is about resolving a setup problem that affects testing rather than adding new tests or test code.

Therefore, the label ""testing"" makes sense here because it's related to fixing issues that prevent tests from running properly in Eclipse.

The label ""testing"" accurately reflects the issue as the patches addressed an environment setup necessary for test execution.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The user gave a bunch of patches from a Git repository and asked if labeling it as a bug is correct based on the title, body, and patches. Since there's no explicit title or detailed description here, I have to infer from the context.

Looking at the patches, they're modifying several files related to Vue components, specifically VTreeviewItem and VTreeviewChildren. The changes involve adjustments in click handlers, select logic, keyboard events, and UI rendering. For example, there's a change in how activateItem is handled, modifications to slotProps, and updates to handle loading states.

These kinds of changes typically indicate fixes for unexpected behavior or errors in the code. They're not adding new features but rather correcting how existing components behave. The fact that multiple files are patched suggests it's addressing an issue that was causing incorrect functionality.

Additionally, the presence of functions like onClick and onKeyDown being modified implies that there were issues with user interactions not working as intended. Fixing these would fall under bug fixes rather than new features or enhancements.

So, considering all this, it does seem like the label ""bug"" is appropriate because the patches are resolving issues in the code's functionality.

The error above made me wonder, are we checking for NAN on the ""input"" tensor to operations that don't have to have valid inputs?  (E.g. recv takes 'tensor' as input, but then writes to it.  the values in 'tensor' can be garbage at the beginning- checking for NAN would be pointless).

Indeed, we are checking input tensors to all pointToPoint() and collective() without consideration of whether they are 'real' inputs or 'output placeholders'.  This is a definite bug.

### **Bug 1**: we check for NAN even on 'output' inputs.  We should only check tensors that are true inputs, depending on the type of operation.

However, a simple fix to avoid the nan check on RECV ops isn't enough.  It does fix the exact error above, but presents a new (more confusing) one:

Note: a complete fix for this bug needs to also gate nan checking on certain collectives- e.g. for scatter, only one rank has a valid input, others should be ignored.

### Repro2 shows another IMA that appears unrelated to Bug1
<details><summary>Repro 2</summary>
Run via `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 torchrun --nproc_per_node 2 repro.py`

```This code snippet initializes a distributed process group using NCCL backend for GPU communication. It then performs two all-reduce operations on a tensor of ones across multiple ranks, prints the tensor after each operation, waits for all operations to complete, and finally destroys the process group. The function `repro` is called with rank and world size obtained from environment variables.```
</details>

Repro 2 should avoid the issue of the 'output' inputs being used becuase it only uses AllReduce operator, for which all inputs are valid inputs on all ranks.  A few notable points for this repro:

* having only 1 allreduce, things pass
* adding extra cuda synchronize() calls and print statements does not change anything, but i tried them as an unsuccessful way to narrow down the error
* adding the second allreduce (and nan-check) causes an IMA error with a stack trace similar to the one above- implicating deallocation and `~TensorImpl`

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""distributed"" is appropriate for this issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions problems with NCCL NaN checks leading to deallocation issues and a crash. NCCL is related to distributed training in PyTorch, as it's used for multi-GPU communication. So that immediately makes me think this has something to do with distributed systems or distributed computing.

Next, I read through the body of the issue. It describes two separate problems: one with point-to-point operations (send/recv) and another with AllReduce. Both of these are collective operations used in distributed training. The fact that the problem arises when using multiple GPUs further supports this being a distributed issue.

The patches provided also give some clues. They modify functions related to collectives like broadcast, scatter, and point-to-point communication in the NCCL backend. These changes involve adding conditions to control when NaN checks are performed, which directly relates to how data is handled across different processes or GPUs in a distributed setup.

Furthermore, the test cases added target scenarios where NaNs are introduced in send/recv buffers and AllReduce operations. These tests are designed to ensure that the fixes prevent crashes under specific distributed training conditions.

So putting it all together, the issue revolves around problems occurring during distributed operations using NCCL, which is a key component of PyTorch's support for distributed computing. The patches address how NaN checks are handled in these collective operations, ensuring they don't cause unintended crashes during data distribution across multiple GPUs or processes.

Therefore, the label ""distributed"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue because it's fundamentally about handling operations and errors within a distributed training context using NCCL.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""typo"" correctly reflects the GitHub issue report provided. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Fix typo in the JavaDoc of JavaConventions class."" The word ""typo"" is right there, which suggests that the main purpose of this issue is to correct a typo in some documentation.

Next, the body says it's a forward port of another issue (#40637) to the 3.2.x branch. That doesn't give much detail but indicates it's related to an existing fix being applied to a different version.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are two lines that were changed in the JavaDoc comments. The original line had ""varags"" and after the patch, it was corrected to ""varargs."" So, they fixed a spelling mistake where ""varags"" should have been ""varargs.""

Putting this all together: the title mentions fixing a typo, the body refers to porting that fix, and the patch shows a correction from ""varags"" to ""varargs,"" which is indeed a typo. Therefore, the label ""typo"" seems appropriate because the issue was specifically about correcting a spelling error in the documentation.

I don't see any other changes or issues addressed here—it's solely focused on that one typo fix. So yes, the label accurately reflects the problem being solved.
</think>

The label ""typo"" correctly identifies the issue as it involves fixing a spelling mistake in the JavaDoc.

```This code snippet imports the `torch` library and defines a simple neural network model using PyTorch. It then creates an instance of this model, generates random input data, and exports the model to ONNX format with fake execution enabled. The ONNX model and associated checkpoint are saved to specified paths. The `save` method is called twice with identical parameters.```
What should be the expected behavior after the second `onnx_program.save`?

Detecting duplicates is possible, but because they are in a protobuf list and the list of initializers can be huge, doing this can be costly.

Options are
1) Detecting duplicates and replace the existing one with the new. That incurs in creating a `Dict[name, index]` before save starts to cache all existing initializers
2) Detect duplicates and don't override with the new one. That incurs in creating a `Set(name)` to cache all existing initializers
3) Allow duplicates. Faster as we don't have to do any check, but the onnx file can be duplicated elements

### Versions

main",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is ""[ONNX] What should be the behavior for multiple calls to torch.onnx.ONNXProgram.save?"" That suggests it's a question about the expected behavior when someone calls the save method more than once on an ONNX program. 

Looking at the body, the user describes a bug scenario where they call `onnx_program.save()` twice with the same parameters. They're asking what should happen in this case. The options provided are about handling duplicates: either replace them, ignore them, or allow duplicates.

The user then explains that detecting duplicates can be costly because initializers are stored in a protobuf list, which could be large. So they present three options for how to handle it, each with different trade-offs between correctness and performance.

Now, the patches provided seem to address this issue by adding checks to prevent duplicate initializers when saving multiple times. In Patch 1, there are additional assertions to ensure that after consecutive saves, the number of initializers remains correct. This suggests they added tests or validations to handle the case where save is called multiple times.

Patch 2 shows changes in the `save_model_with_external_data` function. It looks like they're tracking existing initializers and deleting duplicates before appending new ones. They create a dictionary of existing initializers, then mark which ones to delete if they already exist, ensuring that on subsequent saves, duplicates are removed. This way, each save doesn't add redundant data.

So, what's the nature of this issue? It seems like it's about preventing bugs when saving ONNX models multiple times. The problem is that without handling duplicates, the model file could become bloated or have incorrect initializers. The patches fix this by detecting and removing duplicates before adding new ones, thus maintaining consistency and efficiency.

Now, considering the label ""enhancement."" Typically, an enhancement refers to a new feature or improvement that isn't necessarily fixing a bug but adds functionality or improves performance. However, in this case, the issue is about correcting behavior when using existing functionality (the save method) multiple times. This sounds more like a bug fix than an enhancement because it's addressing unintended behavior that could lead to errors or inefficiencies.

If the save method didn't handle multiple calls properly before, and now it does, that’s fixing a bug. Enhancements are usually for adding new features or improving existing ones without necessarily solving a problem in functionality. So here, the issue is about ensuring correct behavior under certain conditions, which fits more into a bug fix category.

So, I think the label should be ""bug"" rather than ""enhancement."" The changes prevent incorrect or inefficient behavior, making it a bug fix.
</think>

The label assigned was ""enhancement,"" but based on the analysis, this issue is about fixing unintended behavior when calling `save` multiple times, which is a bug. Therefore, the accurate label should reflect that.

FuelLabs/sway,5769,performance,Excessive Build Time with Forc 0.51.1 Compiler,"## Issue: Excessive Build Time with Forc 0.51.1 Compiler

### Summary

While attempting to address a separate issue described in [FuelLabs/sway#5768](<URL> we opted to test the new Forc 0.51.1 compiler for our Spark-Perps contract. Unfortunately, this led to a new problem where the build process now takes an unexpectedly long time, approximately 40 minutes.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the Spark Perps repository and switch to the relevant branch:
    ```This shell script clones a Git repository, checks out a specific branch, and builds the project using the `forc` tool. Specifically:

1. Clones the repository `spark-perps` from `git@github.com:compolabs/spark-perps.git`.
2. Navigates into the cloned repository directory.
3. Checks out the `feat-forc-51-1` branch.
4. Builds the project using the `forc build` command.```
2. Observe the build time, which extends to about 40 minutes.

### Toolchain Configuration

    ```This TOML configuration sets the toolchain to the nightly version for aarch64-apple-darwin architecture and specifies versions for `forc` and `fuel-core` components.```

### Expected Behavior

The expectation for the build process, especially with newer compiler versions, is to either maintain or improve build times, making development efficient and streamlined.

### Actual Behavior

The actual build time with Forc 0.51.1 extends to about 40 minutes, which significantly hinders development speed and efficiency.

### Additional Information

- If further diagnostic logs or details are required, please let me know. I'm available for direct messages on Telegram ([@defi_defiler](<URL> for additional coordination or to provide more details.

Thank you for your attention and support in resolving this issue.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""performance"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title is about excessive build time with a specific compiler version. The body explains that using Forc 0.51.1 caused the build process to take around 40 minutes, which is way too long and slows down development. They provided steps to reproduce, toolchain config, expected behavior, and so on.

Now looking at the patches. There are two main parts in the patch: one where some constants are added or modified, and another where passes are appended for optimizations like DCE (Dead Code Elimination) and FUNC_DCE. These seem aimed at optimizing the build process by removing unnecessary code, which should make the compiler run faster.

The label assigned is ""performance."" Since the issue is about build time being too slow, which relates to how well the system performs during compilation, ""performance"" makes sense. The patches also target optimization passes that improve performance by reducing redundant steps or code, thus speeding up the build process.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but ""performance"" captures both the problem (slow builds) and the solution (optimizations to speed things up). So yes, the label fits.

sveltejs/svelte,12859,runtime error,Svelte 5: Setting a store tries to update the signal instead in certain situations,"### Describe the bug

In a SvelteKit app, I'm putting a store on `data` so that one page can tell a layout about whether to temporarily hide a navigational item. Svelte 5's `$:` sorting logic appears to differ from Svelte 4's in this case, and the update to the store is trying to happen before the store itself has been destructured from the `data` prop. (At least that's what I think is happening. I'm still not sure though why I'm getting 'store.set is not a function' and not 'store is not defined' if this is the case.)

In my case, the workaround is pretty easy - use `store.set(...)` instead of `$store = ...` - but it was still confusing, especially when this was being masked by #12857.

### Severity

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

The issue title says: ""Svelte 5: Setting a store tries to update the signal instead in certain situations."" Hmm, that sounds like when someone sets a store value, something goes wrong with signals. 

Looking at the body, the user describes a bug where using a store in SvelteKit causes an error. They mention getting 'store.set is not a function' which suggests that somewhere, their code expects store to have a set method but it's not available. They also note that replacing `$store = ...` with `store.set(...)` fixes the issue. So, this indicates that the problem arises when trying to assign directly to $store, leading to an error at runtime.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 is a fix to ensure ""$store"" reads are properly transformed. Patches 2 and 4 modify how store access works, introducing a get_store function that caches the result of visiting the store expression. This seems like it's changing how the store is accessed in the compiled code to prevent it from being undefined when used.

Patch 3 adds a test where clicking a button should toggle the store value without errors. This test probably ensures that after the fix, assigning to $store works as expected.

The label assigned was ""runtime error."" A runtime error typically occurs during execution, not at compile time. In this case, the user encountered an error when trying to set the store, which happens while the app is running, so it's a runtime issue. The patches are addressing how Svelte handles store updates, preventing such errors.

Therefore, since the problem causes an error during execution and the patches fix that behavior, ""runtime error"" seems like an accurate label.

denoland/deno,24782,panic,Deno crash when specifying sourceURL comment during async code evaluation.,"Version: Deno 1.45.4

Run this code and Deno will crash...

`````The code creates an asynchronous function using `AsyncFunction` and attempts to call it. The function body contains a syntax error due to the missing `=>` before `return`.```
...with this output...

`````````The log indicates that Deno has experienced a panic, which is a critical failure. This occurred on macOS ARM architecture with Deno version 1.45.4.

The log also advises reporting this as a bug and includes instructions for providing more detailed information if the issue can be reliably reproduced.```

To resolve, simply remove the `sourceURL` line. Now it'll fail as expected.
",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""panic"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Deno crash when specifying sourceURL comment during async code evaluation."" The word ""crash"" here suggests that Deno is crashing or failing unexpectedly, which could be related to a panic in the program.

Next, the body of the issue describes running specific code and Deno crashing. The output provided includes a message saying ""Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno."" It also mentions that the thread 'main' panicked because it called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value. This clearly indicates a panic occurred, which aligns with the label.

The user then explains that removing the sourceURL line fixes the issue, but the problem occurs when that line is present. The crash happens during async code evaluation, so it's tied to how Deno handles certain code structures or comments.

Looking at the patches provided, they seem to be updating dependencies and modifying initializations in the Rust code. Specifically, some patches update versions of deno_core, deno_ops, and serde_v8. Others modify how `JsRuntime::init_platform` is called, adding a boolean parameter related to Deno features. These changes likely address the panic by ensuring proper initialization or handling cases that lead to None being unwrapped.

The key point here is that the issue causes Deno to panic, which is a critical error leading to a crash. The patches focus on fixing this underlying cause, so the label ""panic"" correctly captures the essence of the problem reported.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40364,validation,BindValidationFailureAnalyzer uses wrong target,Forward port of issue #40035 to 3.2.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate if the label ""validation"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""BindValidationFailureAnalyzer uses wrong target"". This immediately tells me that the issue is about a class named BindValidationFailureAnalyzer having an incorrect target. That suggests it's related to validation failures in binding, which ties into validation processes.

Next, the body of the issue says, ""Forward port of issue #40035 to 3.2.x."" So this is a forward port, meaning they're applying a fix from another branch (probably a bug fix) into the 3.2.x version. That tells me it's about resolving an existing issue related to validation.

Now, looking at Patch 1:

- It changes code in the `analyze` method where they're finding a BindValidationException and then a BindException.
- The original code had `BindException target = findCause(rootFailure, BindException.class);`
- Then it used `target` when creating ExceptionDetails.
- The patch changes this to `bindException.getTarget().getType()`, so instead of passing the BindException itself as the target, they're now using its target's type.

This indicates that previously, the wrong object was being passed (the exception instead of its target), which would affect how validation failures are analyzed and reported. So this is definitely a fix related to validation failure analysis.

Patch 2 modifies some test cases:

- The original test had assertions checking for specific failure messages with fields like ""test.foo.foo"", etc.
- After the patch, they're adding another assertion that checks if the description contains a message about binding failing to a target class. This suggests that before the fix, the test wasn't catching whether the correct target was being reported in the failure analysis.

Putting it all together: The issue is about correcting how validation failures are analyzed by ensuring the right target is used when creating exception details. This directly impacts the accuracy of validation error reporting and analysis. Therefore, the label ""validation"" accurately reflects this issue because it's centered around fixing a problem in handling validation exceptions and their associated targets.
</think>

The label ""validation"" is appropriate for this issue as it pertains to correcting how validation failures are analyzed by ensuring the correct target is used.

### Operating System

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""crash"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at all the information provided.

The issue title is about applying a zero offset to a null pointer in zend_hash.c. That sounds like it's related to some kind of memory error or undefined behavior, which could cause a crash. The body of the issue includes a test case that triggers this problem when run with PHP 8.4.0-dev on Ubuntu.

The test code provided uses Phar functionality and includes various operations like creating Phar archives, setting metadata, and trying to access files within them. When this test is run, it results in an error from the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, specifically mentioning an undefined behavior at a certain line in zend_hash.c. This indicates that there's a null pointer being accessed with a zero offset, which is unsafe.

Looking at the patches provided, Patch 1 updates the NEWS file to mention two bugs: GH-13836 and GH-13833. The latter is about applying zero offset to a null pointer, which directly relates to this issue. Patch 2 modifies some code in phar_parse_pharfile, where it invalidates some hash tables. This might be preventing the use of already freed or corrupted data, which could cause a crash.

Patch 3 and 4 seem to adjust the test cases. Patch 3 changes the test from GH-13836 to GH-13833 and updates the expected output to reflect an internal corruption error when trying to read past the buffer end. This suggests that without the fix, the test would fail due to this crash. Patch 4 moves the original test for GH-13836 back into place, ensuring both issues are tested separately.

Now, considering the label ""crash"", it's appropriate because the issue involves a null pointer dereference leading to undefined behavior detected by sanitizers. This kind of error can cause program crashes or unexpected behavior, so labeling it as a crash makes sense. The patches fix this by invalidating hash tables and adjusting tests, which prevents the crash from occurring.

So yes, the label accurately reflects the problem described in the issue.
</think>

The label ""crash"" is appropriate because the issue involves a null pointer dereference leading to undefined behavior, which can cause crashes. The patches address this by preventing such errors, confirming the label's accuracy.

rust-lang/rust,119659,warning,dead_code suggestion would break the semantics of code using`#[repr(transparent)]`,"This occurs in aya:
<URL>

On a nightly that includes <URL> I get:
`````````````````The code defines a `PrintkArg` struct with a single `u664` field, which is never read. This results in a dead code warning. The warning can be suppressed by changing the field to a unit type `()`.```

In a strict sense the compiler is correct. That's because `PrintkArg` is used like so:
`````````This Rust function `bpf_printk_impl` is an unsafe function that prints formatted messages using BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) printk. It takes a fixed-size byte slice `fmt` and a slice of `PrintkArg` with a specified number of arguments. The function uses variadic arguments and transmutes an integer to a function pointer to call the `printk` function. It handles up to three fixed arguments directly and uses a generated function for more than three arguments.```

Thus the compiler's suggestion would break the semantics of this code. [Playground](<URL> /cc @shepmaster ",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""warning"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, let's look at the issue title: ""dead_code suggestion would break the semantics of code using `#[repr(transparent)]`"". This suggests that the compiler is issuing a dead code warning that's problematic because following it would break the code's intended behavior. So the issue is about a specific type of warning related to dead code.

In the body, the user explains that on a nightly Rust version with a certain PR included, they get an error about a field never being read. The struct in question uses `#[repr(transparent)]`, and changing it as the compiler suggests would break the code's semantics. They provide a playground link to demonstrate this.

The patches provided modify how the MarkSymbolVisitor handles structs and unions with certain representations. Specifically, they change variables related to treating fields as live based on whether the struct is transparent or C-like. The test added in Patch 2 ensures that such cases don't trigger dead code warnings, which means the compiler now correctly ignores these fields when appropriate.

The label assigned was ""warning"". Since the issue revolves around a dead_code warning and the solution involves preventing false positives for certain structs, this seems accurate. The problem is about the compiler emitting an incorrect warning, so labeling it as a warning makes sense.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""failure"" accurately reflects the provided issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: ""You are a a test"". Hmm, that doesn't seem very descriptive or indicative of an error. Maybe it's just a placeholder or a mistake. But I'll focus more on the body and the patches since those usually have more detailed information.

The body describes someone who is a test, but then there's a long conversation about handling security indices in Elasticsearch tests. The user provided several code patches related to deleting and creating security indexes before running tests, which suggests that they encountered issues during testing where the setup or teardown of the security index wasn't handled correctly, leading to test failures.

The patches themselves are modifying methods like `deleteSecurityIndexIfExists()`, adding set up methods in test classes, and handling exceptions when creating indices. These changes indicate that without proper management of the security index, tests were failing because they couldn't set up the environment correctly or faced issues with migration states.

So putting it all together: the issue was about test failures due to improper handling of security indexes during testing. The label ""failure"" seems appropriate here since the problem was causing tests to fail and needed fixes in the codebase to resolve those failures.
</think>

The label ""failure"" accurately reflects this issue report because it pertains to test failures caused by incorrect handling of security indices, which were resolved through code patches.

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by looking at all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""SEGV Zend/zend_API.h:2316 dl"". SEGV usually refers to a segmentation fault, which happens when a program tries to access memory it's not allowed to. So that's definitely pointing towards some kind of runtime error or crash.

Looking at the body, the user provided a PHP script that uses the dl() function to load a shared object file and then calls a function from it. The output shows an undefined behavior sanitizer error: a member access within a null pointer of type 'zend_string'. That's a clear indication of accessing memory that hasn't been properly initialized, which is a runtime issue.

The patches made to resolve the issue are several. Patch 1 mentions fixing a bug related to observer segfault on function loaded with dl(). Segfaults are segmentation faults, so again, this is about a runtime crash. Patch 2 modifies how functions are registered, particularly when observers are enabled. It seems they're ensuring that certain flags (internal_function->T) are set correctly to prevent null pointer access. 

Patch 3 adds a new method in the DlTest class and registers it properly, which suggests that without this, the function might not have been correctly initialized, leading to the null pointer. Patch 4 defines a class with a test method, ensuring that when dl() is used, the classes and functions are properly registered so that there's no null reference.

Patch 5 updates the stub file and adds method definitions for the new DlTest class. This likely ensures that when the extension is loaded dynamically using dl(), the internal structures in PHP are correctly set up to avoid null pointers.

Finally, Patch 6 adds a test case that checks if loading the extension and calling functions/methods works without causing segfaults or runtime errors. The test expects certain outputs, which would fail if there was still an issue.

Putting this all together: the problem was a segmentation fault due to accessing a null pointer when using dl() with observer functionality enabled. All patches address function registration, class methods setup, and proper handling of observers during runtime. These are all related to preventing runtime crashes or undefined behavior.

So, does ""runtime error"" accurately reflect this issue? Yes, because the issue was a crash (segfault) happening at runtime when certain conditions were met. The patches fix the underlying cause of that runtime error by ensuring proper initialization and handling of internal structures.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue because it involves a segmentation fault caused by accessing a null pointer during execution, which is addressed by the provided patches.

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

Google Chrome: Version 126.0.6478.126 (Official Build) (64-bit)
OS: Fedora Linux 40 (Workstation Edition)

1. Create the following files:

loader-hooks/loader.js
```This code snippet exports three asynchronous functions: `initialize`, `resolve`, and `load`. These functions appear to delegate their work to `nextResolve` and `nextLoad` respectively, without performing any additional actions.```

loader-hooks/registration.js
`````The code imports `url` and `register` from their respective modules, gets the filename of the current module using `url.fileURLToPath`, and registers a loader with that filename and URL.```

build.js
```The code snippet logs ""success"" to the console.```

2. Install nvm, so you can switch between NodeJS 18 and NodeJS 20.
3. Run the following commands from your directory:

```The code snippet uses `nvm` to switch to Node.js version 18, then runs two commands to execute `build.js` using Node.js, with and without debugging support.```

4. When the debugger for the last command is available, in Google Chrome, visit chrome://inspect/#devices .  You should have a Target link for `./build.js` available.  Click it, and observe the Chrome DevTools window.  The Play button should be active.  You can hit Play and the debugging session will finish cleanly.

5. Close the Chrome Developer Tools window, to terminate the debugging session.
6. Run the following commands from your directory:

```The code snippet uses `nvm` to switch to Node.js version 20, then runs two instances of `node`:

1. The first instance imports `registration.js` from `./loader-hooks/` and executes `build.js`.
2. The second instance does the same but with debugging enabled via `--inspect-brk`.```

7. Repeat step 4.

This time you will not have a Play button.  The Developer Tools window is stuck, unable to proceed.

The _only_ difference here is Node 20 versus Node 18.

### How often does it reproduce? Is there a required condition?

Always.

### What is the expected behavior? Why is that the expected behavior?

The Developer Tools in Google Chrome should be able to step through the code.  This worked when using Node 18 as the debuggee.

### What do you see instead?

No ability to step through code or inspect variables.  The Developer Tools are unusable and the NodeJS process is presumably waiting for the Developer Tools to step forward..

### Additional information

I do not know if this is a Google Chrome bug or a NodeJS bug.  Somewhere between the two, the debugging handshake fails.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""regression"" accurately reflects the issue described in the GitHub report. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the title of the issue is about Node.js 20 having problems with --import, --inspect-brk, and Chrome DevTools not working together, which worked fine in Node.js 18. So right away, this seems like something that was working before but stopped working after an update. That's a key point because regressions are exactly that—issues that appear after a change.

Looking at the body, the user provided detailed steps to reproduce the bug. They showed that when using Node 18, everything works as expected with Chrome DevTools, but switching to Node 20 causes the debugger to get stuck. This indicates that the problem is specific to Node.js 20 and wasn't present in the previous version.

The patches provided are a bit technical, but I can see they're making changes related to isolate data, per-isolate options, and some debugging functionalities. They also added tests specifically for this issue, which suggests that this was a new bug introduced in Node.js 20.

Now, considering what a regression is: it's when a feature or functionality that used to work correctly stops working after a change or update. In this case, the debugging functionality with Chrome DevTools worked on Node.js 18 but broke on Node.js 20. So yes, this fits the definition of a regression because it's an unintended backward change.

The label ""regression"" is appropriate here because it accurately describes that this is a bug introduced in a newer version that wasn't present before. The patches and tests also support this by addressing the specific problem that arose after the update.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""ci"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""[CI] CohereServiceTests testInfer_StreamRequest_ErrorResponse failing"". The title starts with [CI], which usually stands for Continuous Integration. That suggests that the issue is related to a CI build or test failure. So right off the bat, this seems relevant to CI processes.

Next, the body of the issue provides details about build scans and a reproduction line using Gradle commands. It also mentions applicable branches and failure history with a link to a dashboard, which likely tracks test failures over time. This all points towards an issue that's occurring during automated testing in a CI environment. The fact that it's failing in specific tests indicates a problem that the CI system is catching.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are multiple patches, and each seems to address issues related to the tests failing. For example, Patch 1 mentions mitigating IOSession timeouts, which could be causing test failures. Patches 2 through 9 show changes in test methods where the @AwaitsFix annotation is removed or modified, and some error handling in the code is adjusted. These changes suggest that the root cause of the test failures was addressed in the codebase, likely fixing issues that were causing CI tests to fail.

The failure message indicates an AssertionError expecting an ElasticsearchStatusException but not receiving it. This could mean that the test was failing because the expected exception wasn't being thrown due to a bug in the code under test or in the test itself. The patches seem to adjust how errors are handled, ensuring that the correct exceptions are thrown and caught during testing.

Considering all these points—the title indicating a CI issue, the body providing CI-related context and reproduction steps, and the patches addressing problems that would cause CI tests to fail—it seems clear that this issue is indeed related to CI.

golang/go,67059,randomness,math/rand/v2: add ChaCha8.Read,"Currently, if an application needs to generate a reproducible sequence of random bytes, it can choose amongst

* `math/rand.(*Rand).Read`, which uses the predictable Go 1 random number generator; or
* making a zeroReader that returns a sequence of zero bytes and using `cipher.StreamReader` to combine it with a `*chacha20.Cipher`, which is pretty inconvenient.

Since we now have a pretty good secure, deterministic, and specified RNG as math/rand/v2.ChaCha8, it makes sense to add a Read method to it.

```This code snippet defines a method `Read` for a type `*ChaCha8`. The method takes a slice of bytes `p []byte` as input and returns an integer `n` representing the number of bytes read, and an error `err` if any occurred.```

Since it's on the `*ChaCha8` value, it's not going to be accidentally misused in place of crypto/rand.

Okay, let's break down what I need to do here. I have an issue report with a label ""randomness"" assigned to it. My task is to determine whether this label accurately reflects the content of the issue based on its title, body, and the patches provided. If yes, output 1; if no, output 0.

First, I'll start by understanding what each part of the issue report contains. The user provided a title, a body with some code snippets, and several patches to a repository. My focus is on whether the label ""randomness"" fits this context.

Looking at the title: it's about ensuring that ChaCha20 RNG properly handles read buffer when the underlying getrandom() call produces variable-length outputs. So, the issue seems related to how random numbers are generated, specifically using the ChaCha20 algorithm. That immediately makes me think of randomness because it's about the RNG (Random Number Generator).

Next, the body describes some patches. From what I can see in the provided code, there are changes to how read operations handle variable-length outputs from getrandom(). This suggests they're addressing issues where the RNG might not function correctly if getrandom() doesn't return a fixed amount of data. Proper handling here is crucial for maintaining randomness and preventing potential biases or predictable outputs.

The patches also include changes to functions that manage reading from the RNG, ensuring they loop until enough data is read, which directly ties into the quality and reliability of the random number generation. This reinforces the idea that the issue is about improving the randomness implementation.

Additionally, there's a new test added to verify the correct behavior when getrandom() returns short reads. Testing for such edge cases is important for ensuring the RNG's robustness, again pointing towards the randomness aspect.

Looking at the labels assigned, ""randomness"" seems spot on because all changes are centered around enhancing how random numbers are generated and handled in the system. The problem isn't about security per se, but about the correct functioning of the RNG, which is a key component of randomness.

I don't see any elements in the issue that would suggest it's about something else like performance or security directly. It's all about ensuring the RNG works as intended when getrandom() behaves variably.

So, putting it all together, the label ""randomness"" accurately captures the essence of this issue report.
</think>

The label ""randomness"" is appropriate because the issue focuses on improving the handling of random number generation using ChaCha20 when getrandom() returns variable-length outputs. The patches and discussions center around ensuring proper RNG functionality, which directly relates to randomness.

golang/go,66578,documentation,net/http: ServeFileFS doc doesn't make sense,"It looks like the [Godoc for `http.ServeFileFS`](<URL> was copied verbatim from `http.ServeFile`.  In particular, the mention of a ""current directory"" doesn't make any sense when serving from an `fs.FS`:

I _think_ the rest of the documentation is correct, except that `ServeFile` needs to be replaced by `ServeFileFS` in a few places.",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""net/http: ServeFileFS doc doesn't make sense."" The word ""doc"" here clearly refers to documentation. So, right off the bat, it seems like this is about a problem in the documentation.

Next, I'll read the body of the issue. It mentions that the Godoc for `http.ServeFileFS` was copied from `http.ServeFile`. Specifically, there's text about relative paths being interpreted relative to the current directory, which doesn't make sense when using an `fs.FS`. The user points out that this part is incorrect because ServeFileFS serves from a filesystem, so the concept of a ""current directory"" doesn't apply. They also note that the rest of the documentation seems correct except for some instances where ""ServeFile"" should be replaced with ""ServeFileFS."" So, the issue is about inaccuracies and necessary corrections in the documentation.

Now, looking at the patches provided. The first patch modifies a comment related to `ServeFile`, changing references from ServeFile to [ServeFile] with a link, which seems like a minor formatting adjustment but doesn't directly address the issue described. However, the second patch is more substantial. It updates the comments in the `ServeFileFS` function. The changes include removing the part about relative paths and the current directory since that's not applicable to `fs.FS`. They also replace mentions of ""ServeFile"" with ""ServeFileFS"" and update other parts to reflect the correct function, such as changing ""ServeFile will reject requests"" to ""ServeFileFS will reject requests.""

These patches are clearly focused on correcting the documentation. They're updating comments in the code to accurately describe how `ServeFileFS` works, removing misleading information, and ensuring that references within the docs point to the right functions.

Putting it all together: The issue is about incorrect or confusing documentation for a specific function, and the patches fix those documentation issues by correcting and clarifying the comments. Therefore, the label ""documentation"" fits perfectly because the problem lies within the documentation, not the code functionality itself.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to documentation corrections.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""metrics"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report titled ""Upgrade to Micrometer 1.14.0."" 

First, I'll look at the title and body of the issue. The title clearly states an upgrade to Micrometer version 1.14.0. The body provides a link to the release notes of that specific version.

Next, I'll examine the patch provided. It shows a change where the Micrometer library's version is updated from ""1.14.0-RC1"" to ""1.14.0."" This indicates that the issue was resolved by updating the dependency on Micrometer.

Now, considering what Micrometer does: it's a metrics library used for monitoring and measuring applications. The upgrade directly relates to the metrics functionality within the project because Micrometer is responsible for handling metrics.

The label in question is ""metrics,"" which aligns perfectly with the purpose of Micrometer. Since the issue involves upgrading this specific library, using the ""metrics"" label makes sense as it categorizes the issue appropriately under metrics-related changes.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content and resolution of the issue.

spring-projects/spring-framework,34043,runtime error,`DataBinder` throws `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` for map property without nested property path,"Since upgrading to Spring 6.2. we have the Issue that maps in form-data requests are no longer working.
After switching the DTO to using String keys, we are now getting an IndexOutOfRange in `DataVinder.createMap`

the issue seems to be the +2 in `String nestedPath = name.substring(0, endIdx + 2);` this works if the name is something like: `mapname[91].myparam` but not if the map is just key and value then having name `mapname[91]` 

The tests for this method do not cover my case so I am wondering if this my usecase might no longer be supported?

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue based on the provided information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""`DataBinder` throws `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` for map property without nested property path"". The key point here is that a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` is being thrown. That's definitely an exception, which occurs during runtime when the code is executed. So this indicates a problem happening while the application is running.

Next, I'll look at the body of the issue. The user mentions that after upgrading to Spring 6.2, form-data requests with maps stopped working. They switched their DTO to use String keys and encountered an `IndexOutOfRange` in `DataBinder.createMap`. They also provided a link to a specific commit where the issue might be coming from. They point out that the problem arises when the map doesn't have a nested property path, like just having `mapname[91]` instead of something more complex.

The user also notes that existing tests don't cover this scenario and is unsure if their use case is still supported. This suggests that it's a regression or a bug introduced in Spring 6.2, which causes an exception when handling certain form data structures.

Now, looking at the patches provided to fix the issue:

Patch 1 modifies how `nestedPath` is extracted from the name string. It changes the substring logic to conditionally take more characters only if they exist, preventing the index from going out of bounds. This directly addresses the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Patch 2 adds several test cases in a JUnit test class. These tests seem to cover different scenarios of posting data—maps, arrays, lists—with and without indexes. The presence of these tests suggests that the previous code didn't handle all edge cases correctly, leading to the runtime exception.

Putting it all together: the issue is about an unexpected exception being thrown when processing form data with maps in certain structures after an upgrade. This exception occurs during execution (runtime), which aligns with the ""runtime error"" label. The patches fix the code to prevent this exception and add tests to cover these cases, confirming that the problem was indeed a runtime issue.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue because it involves an exception thrown during execution when handling specific form data structures.

I have a failing test case for this, but it's a little hard to explain. It should be rare, but it became visible with the new table render hooks, where we don't have any Goldmark defaults to fall back on.",1,"<think>
Alright, let's break down whether the label ""rendering"" accurately reflects this issue based on the provided information.

First, looking at the issue report title: it doesn't mention rendering explicitly but talks about a problem with tables in Hugo using the Goldmark parser. The body describes that tables aren't being rendered correctly and provides specific examples of incorrect output.

Next, examining the patches made. Patch 11 modifies code related to handling tables in the HTML renderer, ensuring that alignment is captured and passed correctly to templates. Patches 12 introduces test cases for table rendering, checking both HTML and RSS outputs to ensure correctness across different formats. Patch 13 updates the template used for rendering tables, adjusting how styles are applied based on alignment.

All these changes are focused on improving how tables are rendered in the output, addressing issues with alignment and ensuring that attributes and content are displayed as intended. The label ""rendering"" encapsulates all these aspects since it's about how content is processed and presented in the final output.

Thus, considering the patches and their purpose, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""rendering"" correctly captures the essence of the issue, which revolves around how tables are displayed in Hugo's output. The patches address rendering concerns by fixing alignment, attributes, and template processing for tables. Therefore, the answer is:

<sub>[NEXT-3316](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it's about a problem with ESLint configuration. The user is encountering an error where ESLint isn't recognizing certain TypeScript types from the 'expect' module in their test files. They've provided code snippets showing how they're importing these modules and the resulting errors.

Next, I'll look at the patches made to resolve this issue. There are 64 patches listed, each modifying different files in the repository. Most of them seem to be updating import statements from default or namespace imports to type-only imports. For example, changing `import * as expectMod from ""expect"";` to `import type * as expectMod from ""expect"";`. This suggests that the issue was related to how TypeScript handles module types and imports.

The patches also include adding `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` comments in some test files. This indicates that the problem might have been causing ESLint or TypeScript to flag certain variables as unused, which were actually necessary for type checking but not used at runtime.

Putting this together, the issue seems to revolve around configuring TypeScript and ESLint correctly so that they recognize and handle type imports without causing errors. The modifications made are all about adjusting import statements and disabling specific ESLint rules where necessary.

Now, considering the label ""configuration"": it generally refers to how tools like TypeScript and ESLint are set up in a project, including their settings and configurations. In this case, the patches are altering the way modules are imported (using type-only imports) and managing ESLint exceptions, which falls under configuration changes.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem because the solution involved adjusting import statements and ESLint rules—both of which are part of the project's configuration setup.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v6.5.11 
",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""conflict resolution"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Lightning import data error summary trimmed."" The word ""error summary"" suggests that something is wrong with how errors are being displayed or summarized during an import process. The mention of ""trimmed"" implies that part of the information is getting cut off, making it less useful.

Now, moving on to the body of the issue. It's a bug report where the user provided some steps to reproduce the problem. They were using Lightning with certain configurations like duplicate-resolution set to ""record."" When they ran the import and checked the results, instead of the expected failure message pointing them to the correct table in TiDB for conflict details, the table name was trimmed in the console output. However, the log still had the correct information.

The user's expectation was that Lightning should fail and inform the user about the specific table where they could find more details on the conflicts. But what happened instead was that the table name was cut off, making it harder for users to identify where to look without checking the logs.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 removes the WidthMax settings from the table columns in the error output. This means that the table will no longer truncate text based on a maximum width, allowing longer names like database tables to be fully displayed instead of being cut off.

Patch 2 adds a test case where the schema name is very long (""long_long_long_long_long_long_long_long_dbname"") and checks if the error output correctly displays the full table name without truncation. This ensures that even with very long database or table names, the error message remains readable.

So, putting it all together: The issue was about the error summary not showing the full table name because of truncation. The patches fix this by removing width constraints and ensuring longer names are displayed properly.

Now, considering the label ""conflict resolution."" Conflict resolution typically refers to how a system handles data conflicts during import or replication—like deciding what to do when duplicate entries are found. However, in this case, the issue isn't about how conflicts are resolved but rather about the presentation of error messages related to those conflicts. The problem is more about user interface or logging, not the conflict resolution mechanism itself.

Therefore, while the label might seem related because it's about conflicts, it doesn't accurately capture the essence of the bug, which was about the truncation of table names in error summaries. So, the label ""conflict resolution"" isn't the best fit here. A more appropriate label might be something like ""bug,"" ""ui,"" or ""logging,"" but since we're limited to evaluating if ""conflict resolution"" is accurate, it doesn't seem to match.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""[Export] AssertionError in replace_autocast_with_hop_pass"". The presence of ""AssertionError"" indicates that during runtime, an assertion failed. Assertions are typically used to check conditions that should always hold true, so when one fails, it's a sign of an unexpected condition.

Next, examining the body of the issue, there's a detailed traceback showing where the error occurred. The error happens in the replace_autocast_with_hop_pass function, specifically during some graph processing. The traceback points to lines where node users are being checked. It seems like the code is attempting to ensure that all nodes and their users belong to the same graph, which makes sense because incorrect graph structures could lead to runtime issues.

The user provided two patches. Patch 1 modifies several test methods by replacing a function call with a method call (self._check_node_users_in_the_same_graph). It also adds a new test case for mixed autocast and set grad scenarios. This suggests that the tests were previously using a local function, which might have caused issues because it wasn't properly checking node users across submodules or nested contexts.

Patch 2 addresses how submodules are named when inlining. The original code directly used the target name from the node, but this could cause naming conflicts if multiple submodules with the same name were being added to the graph. The fix introduces a loop that appends an incrementing number to ""submod"" until a unique name is found, preventing name collisions.

Now, considering what a runtime error means: it refers to any error that occurs while the program is running, as opposed to compile-time errors. An AssertionError during execution definitely qualifies as a runtime error because it's detected when the code runs, not during compilation.

The patches aim to fix issues where nodes might be added to the wrong graph or submodules could have conflicting names, both of which would cause incorrect behavior and lead to assertion failures at runtime. By ensuring that each node and its users are in the same graph and that submodules have unique names, these fixes prevent the conditions that caused the AssertionError.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" accurately captures the nature of the problem because it's an error that manifests during execution, specifically an assertion failure related to incorrect graph structures.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" is appropriate here. The issue describes an AssertionError occurring during runtime due to incorrect node handling in the graph processing code.

### Additional information

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report. First, I'll read through the provided information carefully.

The user shared three patches from a Git repository. The first patch seems to modify how certain data structures like ArrayBuffer and TypedArrays are handled in the code. It includes changes in functions related to comparing these structures, adding comments about checking for specific types and using methods like ""every"" for element-wise comparison.

The second patch adds several test cases to check for deep equality between different kinds of arrays and buffers. These tests include scenarios where the expected result should throw an error because the structures are not equal. For example, comparing a Uint8Array with a SharedArrayBuffer when their contents differ is expected to throw an AssertionError.

The third patch adds more test cases to ensure that certain pairs of arrays and buffers are recognized as not equal. This includes specific instances where using assert.deepStrictEqual or assert.partialDeepStrictEqual should throw errors because the objects being compared are different in type or content.

Looking at these changes, it seems like they're addressing issues where the code wasn't correctly handling comparisons between various array types and buffers. For instance, before these patches, comparing a DataView with a TypedArray might not have thrown an error when it should have, leading to incorrect deep equality results.

The label ""bug"" is typically used for issues that are defects or unintended behavior in the code. Since these patches fix scenarios where comparisons were returning incorrect results (like not throwing errors when they should), this indicates that there was a bug in how deep equality checks were implemented for these data structures.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the problem being addressed here because it's about correcting unintended behavior in the code.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through the problem description.

The user reported an issue where running a specific command with `uv sync` results in an error. The command used was `uv sync --locked --no-build --no-install-project`. The error message mentioned a problem validating the lockfile, specifically about a distribution marked as `--no-build` but lacking a binary distribution. They also noted that removing either `--locked` or `--no-build` made it work, which is strange.

Looking at the patches provided, they modified several parts of the code. In Patch 1, they removed `build_options` from the function parameters and replaced them with default build options during validation. This suggests that when validating the lockfile, the system shouldn't strictly require binary distributions if `--no-build` is set.

Patch 2 removed `BuildOptions` from various function calls and structures, which indicates that the build options are no longer being passed around in those contexts. Patch 3 adjusted a test case to include the `--locked` flag without causing an error, ensuring that the command works as expected with these flags.

Putting this together, the issue arose because the system was incorrectly enforcing build options during lockfile validation when it shouldn't have. The patches fixed this by adjusting how build options are handled in validation and tests. This definitely points to a bug in the original code since the behavior didn't align with expected functionality.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because the problem stemmed from incorrect handling of build options during lockfile validation, which was resolved by adjusting the relevant parameters in the code.

### Summary

Per <URL> comment by @Nilstrieb, `is_val_statically_known` only supports primitive types - which is not listed anywhere in the documentation.

When trying to use inside the core library on `core::fmt::Arguments`, compiler crashes #121066.

CC: @NCGThompson 








",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patch that was applied.

First, looking at the title: it says that `is_val_statically_known` only supports primitives and causes an ICE otherwise. An ICE is a compiler crash, so this suggests there's a problem when using the function with non-primitive types.

The body of the issue explains that the current documentation doesn't mention this limitation. It references another PR where someone noted that it only works with primitive types, which isn't documented anywhere. Then, when trying to use it on `core::fmt::Arguments`, the compiler crashes, leading to a different issue. The reporter wants to document this behavior to prevent such issues.

Now, looking at the patch provided: it adds a new section under the function's documentation called ""Type Requirements."" It specifies that T must be a bool, char, primitive numeric type, or thin pointer. Otherwise, it may cause a compiler error. This clearly adds missing information about which types are supported, which was the main point of the issue.

So, the problem in the issue is that the documentation didn't include this important detail, leading to incorrect usage and compiler crashes. The fix addresses this by updating the documentation to reflect these type requirements accurately.

Therefore, the label ""documentation"" fits because the issue was about a missing or incomplete documentation, and the patch corrects it by adding the necessary information.

The label ""documentation"" is appropriate because the issue highlights incomplete documentation leading to incorrect usage, and the fix updates the documentation accordingly.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41504,runtime error,NPE during auto-configuration in OnClassCondition.resolveOutcomesThreaded because firstHalf is null,Forward port of issue #41492 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""NPE during auto-configuration in OnClassCondition.resolveOutcomesThreaded because firstHalf is null."" A Null Pointer Exception (NPE) is definitely a runtime error because it occurs when the code tries to access an object that doesn't exist. So the title itself suggests a problem happening while the application is running.

Now, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #41492 to 3.3.x."" This indicates that the same issue was present in a previous version and now it's being addressed in version 3.3.x. It doesn't add much detail but confirms it's an existing problem that needs fixing.

Looking at the patches made, there are several changes. The first patch updates the copyright year, which isn't directly related to the NPE. Then, in Patch 1, they import ReflectionUtils and modify the ThreadedOutcomesResolver class. They added a Throwable variable 'failure' and wrapped the outcomes resolver in a try-catch block. This means that when an exception occurs during resolution, it's caught and stored in 'failure'. Later, if there was a failure, they rethrow it using ReflectionUtils.

This change is specifically handling exceptions during the threaded resolution of outcomes. By catching any Throwable and rethrowing it later, they're preventing the application from crashing due to unhandled exceptions. This directly addresses the NPE mentioned in the title by ensuring that such runtime errors are properly caught and handled, providing a more robust error management.

So, putting it all together: The issue is about an NPE happening during auto-configuration, which is a runtime error. The patches address this by improving exception handling around the problematic code. Therefore, labeling this as a ""runtime error"" accurately reflects both the problem described and the solution implemented.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue because it involves a Null Pointer Exception occurring during execution, and the patches address this by enhancing exception handling.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""build"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""cmd/asm/internal/arch: unrecognized failures [consistent failure]"". The word ""unrecognized failures"" makes me think that something is going wrong in a consistent way, but I'm not sure what category this falls under yet.

Next, the body of the issue includes a watchflakes header and mentions that it's an automatic collection of these failures. There's a specific example provided with a link to a CI build log showing a failed test for cmd/asm/internal/arch. The mention of ""build failed"" in the example suggests that this is related to the build process.

Now, looking at the patch that resolved the issue. It's a change in the error message formatting where they replaced %p with %d when printing the register value. This seems like a minor fix but it indicates that there was an issue causing failures, possibly in testing or building.

The label assigned is ""build"". Since the failure mentioned is about the build failing and the patch fixes something related to error reporting which could prevent such build failures, I think ""build"" is an appropriate label here. The problem directly impacts the build process, so labeling it as such makes sense.

The error occurs at line 69 of `instantiationService.ts`, and specifically at line 1617 of `terminalInstance.ts`.```
[Go to Errors Site](<URL>",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue has a title: ""InstantiationService has been disposed"". The body shows an error message pointing to a specific line in the code where this error occurs. It's a JavaScript error, which suggests it happens during execution, not at compile time.

Looking at the patches provided, I see that there was a change in how `this.dispose` is called within the TerminalInstance class. Specifically, they removed a dispose call and then added it back in a different place. This indicates that the problem might have been related to improper or premature disposal of resources, leading to an error when trying to access something that's already been disposed.

The term ""InstantiationService has been disposed"" implies that some service was accessed after it had been cleaned up. That's a runtime issue because it relates to how objects are managed in memory during execution.

The label assigned is ""runtime error,"" which makes sense here since the problem occurs while the application is running, not during compilation or build time. The error message itself is about an unexpected state (the service being disposed), which is a classic runtime issue.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but ""runtime error"" seems to fit well because it accurately describes an error that happens when the program is executing, rather than something like a compile error or a logical bug without an exception. The patches also support this by addressing how and when resources are disposed of, which directly impacts runtime behavior.

So yes, the label ""runtime error"" does accurately reflect the nature of this issue based on all provided information.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" correctly identifies that the issue occurs during execution due to improper resource disposal.

microsoft/vscode,233398,bug,Discard edits doesn't change them back on disk,"* get edits from /edit
* save
* discard the edits
* the editor shows the before state
* :bug: the state on disk is still old",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on its title, body, and the patches used to resolve it.

First, looking at the title: ""Discard edits doesn't change them back on disk."" This suggests that when a user discards their edits in the editor, the changes aren't reverted on the actual file system. That sounds like unexpected behavior, which typically indicates a bug.

Next, the body of the issue outlines steps to reproduce the problem. It mentions that after saving and discarding edits, the editor shows the previous state, but the files on disk remain unchanged. This is definitely not the intended functionality when discarding edits, so it fits the definition of a bug.

Now, examining the patches provided:

In Patch 1, there's a change from `this.docFileEditorModel.revert({ soft: true });` to `await this.docFileEditorModel.save({ reason: SaveReason.EXPLICIT });`. This suggests that the original revert operation wasn't correctly updating the file on disk. By changing it to an explicit save, it ensures that the changes are persisted, which would fix the bug where discarding edits didn't update the files.

Patch 2 involves several changes related to service registration and decorations. It imports a new service and modifies how providers are instantiated. This might be addressing some underlying issues in how the editor handles file states and user interactions, contributing to the bug's resolution.

Both patches seem to address the core issue described: ensuring that discarding edits correctly reverts the files on disk. Therefore, the problem was indeed a bug, and the label accurately reflects it.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39386,forward port,Polish,Forward port of issue #39382 to 3.2.x.,0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the issue report provided. Let me start by understanding what each part means.

First, the issue is about a series of patches made to various files in a repository. The main changes seem to involve replacing `Arrays.asList()` with `List.of()`, and there's also an update to the copyright year from 2023 to 2024 in some files. There are also some method signature changes where return types or parameters are adjusted, like changing a method to void from returning a Trigger.

Now, what does ""forward port"" mean in software development? From what I know, forward porting usually refers to taking changes from one version of the codebase and applying them to a future version. This is often done when maintaining different branches, especially in projects with multiple versions or long-term support branches. For example, if a bug fix is applied to version 1.x, it might need to be forward-ported to version 2.x.

Looking at the patches here, they don't seem to be about moving changes from one branch to another. Instead, they're about modernizing code by using more concise Java features (like `List.of()` which is available in Java 9 and above) and updating the copyright information. These are typical of codebase maintenance tasks rather than porting between versions.

Additionally, some methods have their return types changed or parameters adjusted, but these seem like refactoring steps to improve the code's structure or functionality, not necessarily moving existing changes to a newer version.

Therefore, labeling this as ""forward port"" might be incorrect because forward porting implies transferring changes across branches or versions, which doesn't align with the nature of these patches. Instead, these changes are more about code modernization and maintenance.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" does not accurately reflect the issue report. The changes made are related to code modernization and updates rather than moving existing changes between different versions.

```The script `interface_usdt_net.py` failed with a duration of 3 seconds. The test framework initialized and performed several actions, including connecting a P2P test node, checking version message exchanges, and stopping the nodes. The log also mentions a warning about a redefined macro `MIN`.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""test: failure in `interface_usdt_net.py`"". This suggests that there's a test failing related to the interface USDT net functionality. The word ""failure"" here indicates an issue with the tests passing, which could be due to a bug or some other problem.

Moving on to the body of the issue. It starts by mentioning the master commit hash and the environment details like GCC version and Systemtap. Then it provides commands used to build and run the tests. The test output shows that `interface_usdt_net.py` failed after 3 seconds. 

In the stdout, I see that the test framework initialized a directory, hooked into some tracepoints, connected nodes, checked messages, and then stopped and cleaned up successfully, with all tests marked as successful. But wait, if the test was successful, why did it fail overall? That seems contradictory.

Looking at stderr, there's a warning about a macro redefinition: MIN is defined in two places. The first definition is in main.c line 70, and then again in include/linux/minmax.h line 329. This caused a single warning but no error. So the test runner considers this a failure because of the warning.

Now, looking at the patches that fixed this issue. They changed the MIN macro by prefixing it with `_TRACEPOINT_TEST_` to avoid collision. So the problem was that the custom MIN macro in the code was conflicting with another definition from include/linux/minmax.h. This caused a compiler warning which made the test fail.

So, is this a bug? A bug typically refers to an unintended behavior or defect in the code causing incorrect functionality. In this case, the issue is a compile-time warning due to a macro redefinition, not a runtime error or incorrect behavior of the program. The tests were passing functionally but failing because of the warning. 

But wait, does a compiler warning count as a bug? Sometimes projects treat warnings as errors, which would cause the build or test suite to fail. So in that context, even though it's just a warning, if the project configuration treats it as an error, then yes, it's considered a bug because it affects the successful completion of tests.

Therefore, labeling this issue as a ""bug"" is appropriate since it represents an unintended behavior (the macro conflict) causing test failures.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because the problem was due to a macro redefinition that caused test failures. This unintended behavior fits the definition of a bug.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41673,configuration,server.error.include-path does not have a default value in the metadata,Forward port of issue #41667 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and patches.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""server.error.include-path does not have a default value in the metadata."" This suggests that there's an option or setting called server.error.include-path which is missing a default value. The word ""metadata"" here might imply it's related to configuration data.

The body of the issue is brief: ""Forward port of issue #41667 to 3.4.x."" Forward porting usually means applying a fix from one branch (like main) to another (like a release branch, 3.4.x). This indicates that the original issue was already addressed in another context and now needs to be applied here.

Now looking at the patch provided:

Patch 1 adds a new configuration with ""name"": ""server.error.include-path"" and sets its defaultValue to ""always"". So, this change is about adding a default value for a specific server error configuration option. 

This means the issue was about ensuring that a particular configuration parameter has a default value set in the system's metadata. The fix involves modifying the configuration definitions by adding this parameter with its default.

The label assigned is ""configuration,"" which seems appropriate because the problem and solution are centered around setting a default for a configuration option. There's no indication that this relates to a bug, feature request, or other categories. It's purely about configuring server error behavior by ensuring include-path has a default value.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue.

@rustbot label: +T-rustdoc +A-rustdoc-ui",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that resolved it.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""rustdoc: search for type alias says 'type X not found, showing type X instead'"". The title suggests there's an issue with how rustdoc handles searches for type aliases. It mentions a confusing message when searching in certain tabs like ""In Parameters"" and ""In Return Types."" The user provided a screenshot link (though I can't view it), but the description indicates that when searching for something like 'pid_t', the system doesn't find it and shows results for the same name, which is perplexing.

The body of the issue explains that in the ""In Names"" tab, the search works fine, but in other tabs, a message appears saying the type wasn't found but showing results for the same name anyway. This seems like unexpected behavior—users would expect either the correct results or an error if the type isn't found.

Now, looking at the patches that fixed this issue:

Patch 1 modifies the JavaScript function `convertNameToId`. It changes how elements are matched by using a lowercase version of the path and also compares edit distances for both the original and lowercase versions. This suggests they're making the search more flexible, perhaps to handle case insensitivity or typos better.

Patch 2 adds test cases in a new file. These tests seem to check different scenarios, like searching for 'pid_t', 'pidt' (a typo), and with the module path 'unix::'. The expected behavior is that if the exact query doesn't match, it should correct it or show related results. This indicates they're ensuring the search behaves correctly under various query conditions.

Patch 3 introduces a new module `unix` with a type alias `pid_t` and some functions using it. This seems to set up test cases to verify the fix, providing actual code that would be indexed by rustdoc for testing.

Putting this together: The issue was about incorrect or confusing search behavior in rustdoc when dealing with type aliases. The patches improved how searches are handled, making them more robust against typos and case sensitivity, and added tests to ensure these improvements work as intended.

Now, the label assigned is ""bug."" A bug typically refers to an unintended feature or behavior that causes the system to fail to perform its intended function. In this case, the issue describes unexpected search results with confusing messages, which fits the definition of a bug because it's about incorrect functionality.

So, considering all these points, the label ""bug"" does accurately reflect the nature of the problem described in the issue.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate for this issue as it involves unintended behavior in rustdoc's search functionality. The patches address this by improving search handling and adding tests to ensure correct future behavior.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42944,forward port,Add an ArchUnit rule to prohibit unnecessary values on @ConditionalOnMissingBean,Forward port of issue #42941 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Add an ArchUnit rule to prohibit unnecessary values on @ConditionalOnMissingBean"". This suggests that the main goal is to add a new rule in ArchUnit. The body says it's a forward port of issue #42941 to 3.3.x. So, they're taking something from another issue and applying it to this branch.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 adds imports related to ArchUnit, defines a new method `conditionalOnMissingBeanShouldNotSpecifyOnlyATypeThatIsTheSameAsMethodReturnType()`, which creates an ArchRule. This rule checks if methods annotated with `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` don't specify a type that's the same as the return type of the method. There are also some changes in how the rules are added, indicating new functionality.

Patch 2 modifies existing test cases. It removes the explicit value and ignored parameters from the `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations, which aligns with the rule being added. For example, changing from specifying `value = ExampleBean.class` to just using `ignored = CustomExampleBean.class`, which might be the correct way after adding the new rule.

So, putting it all together: The issue is about adding a new ArchUnit rule and adjusting existing code to comply with this rule. But the body mentions it's a forward port of another issue. A ""forward port"" typically means taking changes from one branch (like main) and applying them to another (like 3.3.x). However, in this case, they're not just porting existing changes; they're adding new functionality (the rule) specific to the 3.3.x branch.

Does the label ""forward port"" capture that? I think it might be a bit misleading because forward port usually implies moving existing code without major changes, but here they added a new feature in the process of porting. However, since the body explicitly states it's a forward port from another issue, maybe the primary intention was to apply similar changes to 3.3.x, even if some adjustments were made.

So, considering that the label reflects the intent mentioned in the body, I think ""forward port"" is accurate here because they're moving the issue's resolution from one branch to another, even if it involved adding new code.

astral-sh/uv,8944,package management,Bug(?): uv publish fails if unknown files are present in ./dist,"## Description

When a file is created in the `./dist` directory before running `uv publish`, this file causes `uv publish` to fail. [The documentation states](<URL> that it **ignores** all other files.

<URL>

This issue is clearly minor and does not really impact the user much (the error message is quite clear).

However, I think there is no reason to fail if an unknown file is present – as long as a wheel and/or sdist file is found.

If this failure is deliberate, then I would recommend change the documentation.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Build the project (using `uv build`). The build files will be generated in `./dist`.
2. Create a file in the `./dist` directory. On macOS, this could happen e.g. when opening the directory in Finder, which might create the `.DS_Store` file. Example: `touch ./dist/.DS_Store`
3. Run `uv publish`.

This will fail with the error: `error: File is neither a wheel nor a source distribution: 'dist/.DS_Store'`

## Where does this error come from

The error is raised in `uv_publish::files_for_publishing`:
<URL>

`uv_distribution_filename::DistFilename::try_from_normalized_filename` in turn checks if the files are valid wheel or sdist files. Example for wheels:
<URL>

## Meta

**uv version**:
```The output log indicates that the version of `uv` installed is 0.5.0, and it was installed using Homebrew on November 7, 2024.```",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the label ""package management"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Bug(?): uv publish fails if unknown files are present in ./dist"". This suggests that when there are unexpected files in the distribution directory, the publishing process fails.

The body elaborates that the user expects `uv publish` to ignore non-wheel and non-sdist files, as per the documentation. However, it currently fails when such files exist, like a .DS_Store file created by macOS. The issue includes steps to reproduce, pointing out the error message and where in the code it's raised.

The patches provided address this by modifying how `uv publish` handles unknown files. Instead of failing, it now skips these files with warnings. There's also an added test case to check if these dubious filenames are handled correctly without causing failure.

Now, considering the label ""package management"". This term generally refers to tools and processes related to managing software packages, including their distribution, installation, updates, etc. In this context, `uv publish` is part of a package management workflow since it's responsible for publishing packages (like wheels or sdists) to repositories.

The issue revolves around the behavior of the publish command when encountering unexpected files in the dist directory. This directly relates to how the packaging tool handles distribution files and ensures that only valid packages are processed, which falls under package management.

Moreover, the patches add warnings and tests related to the handling of these distribution files, reinforcing that this is about managing package distribution correctly.

Therefore, the label ""package management"" accurately reflects the issue because it pertains to the functionality of publishing packages and how the tool manages unexpected files in the context of packaging.
</think>

The label ""package management"" accurately reflects the issue as it relates to handling distribution files during the publishing process.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""crash"" is accurate for this issue based on the information provided. Let's start by looking at what each part tells us.

First, the title isn't given directly, but from the patches, it seems like they're related to how the Go runtime handles certain low-level details, especially around goroutines and the m (machine) struct. The patches involve changes in functions like callbackUpdateSystemStack, which manage the stack bounds for goroutines, and modifications to the m struct itself.

The body of the issue isn't provided, but the patches give clues. They're adjusting how the stack is managed when dealing with cgo calls and signal handling. For instance, there's a new field g0StackAccurate added to the m struct to track whether the stack bounds are accurate. Other changes include restoring old stack bounds after callbacks and handling cases where the stack might not be properly set.

Looking at the patches, they seem to address potential issues with stack management that could lead to crashes or incorrect behavior when dealing with concurrent goroutines and cgo calls. For example, callbackUpdateSystemStack is modified to correctly update and restore stack bounds, which if mishandled, can cause segmentation faults or other crashes. Also, adjusting how the g0 stack's accuracy is tracked might prevent situations where the runtime incorrectly accesses memory outside the allowed stack space.

The fact that they're modifying functions related to cgo calls (which involve calling C code from Go) and signal handling suggests that without these fixes, certain operations could lead to instability or crashes. The addition of fields like g0StackAccurate indicates an effort to track the state more precisely, which is a common approach when debugging issues that cause unexpected failures.

So putting this together: the issue seems to be about preventing crashes related to stack management in goroutines, especially during cgo calls and signal handling. Therefore, labeling it as ""crash"" makes sense because the changes are aimed at fixing scenarios where the program might crash due to incorrect stack bounds or state management.

Android

### Joplin version

3.0.8

### Desktop version info

_No response_

### Current behaviour

I created a brand new profile in Joplin desktop using a JEX import, synced with OneDrive (after deleting the old Joplin app data there) and then synced with my Android device with a fresh install of the Joplin app. On both devices I set the 'keep note history for' setting to 1 day, with the intention to reduce the number of objects to sync, required to setup a new device in future. Almost a month later, I attempted a new device sync on Joplin desktop, and the total number of synced objects had gone up from the initial value of about 350 to about 850 objects - even though the number of new notes were minimal, and I did not create any new tags since creation of the profile. When I view the note history in Joplin desktop on the new device, it does correctly limit the note history to the last 24 hours. However, when I check inside the SQLite database of the newly setup device, the size of the database file had grown significantly since the original version, and the revisions table contains all the revisions since creating the profile

### Expected behaviour

Judging from the code here <URL> I would expect that note revisions in the SQLite database created earlier than 24 hours ago would be cleaned in the database. It's worth noting that since creating the profile on Joplin desktop, almost all note creation and modification has been done on my Android device, rather than on Joplin desktop

### Logs

_No response_",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""sync"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me go through each part carefully.

The issue title mentions that old note revisions aren't being deleted from the sync source. That immediately makes me think about how data is synchronized between devices and the server. The body explains that even though settings were changed to limit note history, the database still has old revisions, which affects syncing when setting up a new device. So the problem seems related to how revisions are handled during synchronization.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 changes the way revisions are deleted. It groups revisions by item and processes them, ensuring that only the necessary ones are kept. This definitely impacts how data is synchronized because it affects what's stored and thus what gets synced.

Patch 2 adds a test for handling missing notes and their revisions. This test ensures that when a note is deleted, its old revisions are also removed, which ties into sync processes to prevent outdated data from being transferred.

Patch 3 introduces a new test that checks if old revisions are deleted both locally and remotely, ensuring consistency across synced devices. This directly relates to synchronization because it's about maintaining the same state across all connected clients.

Putting this together, all patches address issues with how revisions are managed during sync operations. They ensure that when data is synced, only relevant and up-to-date information is transferred, preventing unnecessary bloat and ensuring consistency across devices.

Therefore, the label ""sync"" accurately reflects the issue because it's centered around problems arising from synchronization processes and how data revisions are handled during these syncs.

The label ""sync"" is appropriate as the issue pertains to how note revisions are managed during synchronization across devices, impacting the sync process and data consistency.

Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""ice"" is appropriate for this issue. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.

First, what does ""ICE"" mean in programming terms? From what I remember, ICE stands for Internal Compiler Error. That usually happens when the compiler encounters an unexpected situation and crashes or produces an incorrect error message. So, if the problem was causing the compiler to crash or give a wrong error, it would be labeled as an ICE.

Looking at the issue description provided, there's a lot of output that seems like compilation failure messages. The user included what looks like a command line output with exit status 101 and some linker errors, possibly related to Rust code. Then they provided two patches that fixed the problem.

The first patch is modifying the `LateLintPass` for `OpaqueHiddenInferredBound`. It adds a condition to skip certain cases where the opaque type is from a trait method without a body. The second patch is a test case ensuring that a specific lint doesn't fire on RPITITs (Return Position Impl Trait In Type) with no hidden type.

So, the problem seems to be about incorrect behavior in the compiler's linter when dealing with certain opaque types in traits. The patches are preventing a false positive in the linter by adding conditions to skip over cases where there's no actual hidden type to cause an issue.

Now, was this causing an Internal Compiler Error? From the provided information, it doesn't seem like the compiler itself was crashing or producing incorrect code. Instead, it might have been emitting a lint warning that wasn't appropriate for certain cases. The patches are about improving the accuracy of the linter rather than fixing a crash or incorrect compilation.

Therefore, if the issue was about an incorrect warning being triggered, labeling it as ""ice"" might not be accurate because ICE typically refers to compiler crashes or incorrect errors, not false positives in lint checks. Unless the problem was causing the compiler to emit an error where it shouldn't, which is a bit different from a lint.

But wait, looking back at the user's message, they included some build output with an exit code 101. I'm not sure what that code means, but if it's related to the linker or some build issue, maybe the problem was more severe than just a lint warning. However, the patches provided are about the linter logic.

So, considering all this, perhaps ""ice"" isn't the most accurate label here because the main fix is about the linter rather than an internal compiler error.
</think>

The label ""ice"" doesn't accurately reflect the issue since it was a false positive in the linter, not a compiler crash.

2. Run `bitcoin-qt -testnet`, and either sync or reindex
3. It will assert and crash on its own (without `DEBUG_LOCKORDER`, it will eventually hang)

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Double lock detected in `Warnings::GetMessages()`"". That immediately tells me that there's an issue with locking mechanisms in the code, which is a type of bug. Double locks can cause deadlocks or other concurrency issues, so this seems like a genuine problem.

Next, the body of the issue describes the current behavior where running bitcoin-qt on testnet leads to a deadlock because of a double lock in the warnings code. The user also provides steps to reproduce and relevant logs, which show an assertion failure due to the double lock. All of these are clear indicators of a bug that needs fixing.

The patches provided modify how the lock is handled in the Set method. They replace the manual LOCK with a WITH_LOCK macro, which probably ensures that the lock is properly acquired and released, preventing the double locking scenario. This change directly addresses the issue described, so it's definitely a code fix for a bug.

Putting it all together: The title points to a specific problem, the body details the symptoms and how to reproduce them, and the patch fixes the root cause by correcting the locking mechanism. Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" is accurate because it's an unintended behavior that causes the software to malfunction.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue since it involves a double lock causing a deadlock, confirmed by logs and fixed with patches.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue based on the provided information. Let's start by understanding what each part tells us.

The issue title isn't directly shown here, but looking at the patches and code changes can give clues about the nature of the problem. The user has made several patches to various files in a repository. These patches involve removing references to ""Remoting.Unit.Tests.dll"" from test configurations and build commands. For example, in patch 154, they remove that specific DLL from a list of tests run, and similarly in patch 155, they remove it from an XML configuration.

Additionally, in patch 153, they modify a PowerShell function's ValidateSet parameter to exclude ""winconpty"", but I'm not sure if that directly relates. However, the main focus seems to be on removing references to Remoting tests.

The label ""bug"" is typically used when there's an issue causing incorrect behavior or failures in the codebase. The removal of these test references suggests that those specific tests were either failing, causing problems, or perhaps they're no longer needed because the feature was removed or changed. This could indicate a bug where the remoting functionality was causing issues elsewhere in the system.

Moreover, looking at patch 152, it's a header file with various includes and definitions, but without more context, it's hard to see how that contributes to the bug label. However, considering all patches together, they seem to address an issue where certain tests related to remoting were causing problems and needed to be excluded.

The presence of error handling in patch 150 (like catching hresult_error) also hints at potential bugs being addressed, as proper exception handling is crucial for maintaining application stability.

Putting it all together, the changes likely fix a bug where the Remoting Unit Tests were causing issues, such as test failures or instability. Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects that these patches are resolving an issue in the codebase.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue because the patches address and resolve issues related to problematic tests and potential bugs in the remoting functionality.

ziglang/zig,20355,bug,Bug: Disallowing dynamic linking for os==other should be allowed,"<URL>

This code forbids creating dynamic executables for hobby OS and makes it impossible for me to port Ashet OS to 0.13.

Ashet OS heavily relies on dynamic linking which is used as the syscall interface, and i guess other hobby OS are affected by this as well",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Bug: Disallowing dynamic linking for os==other should be allowed."" The word ""Bug"" is right there in the title, which suggests that the reporter considers this an actual bug rather than a feature request or something else.

Next, the body of the issue explains that certain code in the Zig repository forbids creating dynamic executables for hobby OSes. Specifically, it points to lines 9-14 of target.zig and mentions that this restriction is causing problems for Ashet OS, which relies heavily on dynamic linking as a syscall interface. They also note that other hobby OSes might be affected.

Now, looking at the patch provided: in the function `cannotDynamicLink`, they changed the condition from including both `.freestanding` and `.other` to only `.freestanding`. So before, if the OS tag was either freestanding or other, it would return true, meaning dynamic linking wasn't allowed. After the change, only freestanding is restricted.

So, this patch seems to be fixing a bug where dynamic linking was incorrectly disallowed for certain OS targets, specifically those tagged as ""other."" That aligns with the reporter's issue because they were facing problems due to this restriction when trying to port their OS, which likely falls under the ""other"" category.

The label assigned is ""bug,"" which makes sense here. The issue describes a problem in the code that was causing unintended behavior—blocking dynamic linking for operating systems that should have been allowed to use it. The patch corrects this by adjusting the condition so that only freestanding targets are restricted, allowing ""other"" OSes to enable dynamic linking as needed.

Therefore, considering all these points—the title explicitly mentions a bug, the body explains how existing code is causing problems, and the patch fixes this behavior—it's clear that labeling this issue as a ""bug"" is accurate.

### PHP Version

PHP 8.3.13RC1

### Operating System

Alpinelinux",1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""2 tests fail on Alpinelinux s390x"". This immediately tells me that there are test failures on a specific platform, which is Alpine Linux running on an s390x architecture. The fact that two tests are failing suggests there might be some underlying issues causing these failures.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. It mentions preparing for a next release and rebuilding to upgrade to RC1 for a new libxml. However, when using clang 18.1.8, two tests fail. The first failure is from GH-15168, which shows a stack overflow in json_encode(). The second failure is GH-15169, indicating a stack overflow during variable serialization in the standard extension.

Looking at the error messages:
1. For GH-15168: The test fails because of ""Maximum stack depth exceeded"" and mentions a termsig=0.
2. For GH-15169: It also shows ""Maximum call stack size reached. Infinite recursion?"" with similar termination signals.

These errors point to issues where the code is exceeding the maximum allowed stack depth, leading to runtime exceptions or crashes. Both test failures are due to stack overflows, which are indeed runtime errors because they occur during the execution of the program, not at compile time.

Now, considering the patches applied to resolve these issues:
- Patch 1 modifies a test file in ext/json/tests by adding a while loop that iterates through nodes and adjusts the next pointers. This seems to break a cycle or limit recursion depth.
- Patch 2 does something similar in ext/standard/tests/serialize, adding a loop to modify the node links.

These patches are addressing the root cause of the stack overflows by preventing infinite recursion or deep stacks. They're changes made in the code to avoid reaching the maximum stack depth, which aligns with fixing runtime issues since these errors manifest during execution.

The label ""runtime error"" is assigned to this issue. Given that both test failures are due to stack overflows occurring at runtime, this label seems appropriate. It accurately captures the nature of the problem because the errors happen when the program runs and exceeds the allowed stack size.

So, putting it all together: The issue is about two tests failing because of runtime exceptions caused by exceeding stack depth. The patches fix these by modifying the code to prevent such overflows. Therefore, labeling this as a ""runtime error"" is correct.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, let's look at the title: ""Implement `toString()` in `TestBeanOverrideHandler`"". The title suggests that the issue is about adding a new method, specifically the toString() method. That sounds like a feature addition or improvement rather than a bug fix.

Next, the body of the issue explains that while creating a commit message, someone noticed that the string representation of TestBeanOverrideHandler doesn't include the factory method, unlike similar classes which do include such information. The user suggests implementing toString() to improve diagnostics by including the factoryMethod. This indicates that the problem is about improving the diagnostic capabilities by enhancing an existing class's functionality.

Now, looking at the patches provided. The first patch adds an import for ToStringCreator from Spring, which is a utility for creating string representations. Then, in the TestBeanOverrideHandler class, they override the toString() method using this utility, appending several fields including factoryMethod. This clearly shows that new code was added to improve the way objects of this class are represented as strings.

So, considering all these points, the issue is about adding a new feature (improved string representation) rather than fixing a bug or addressing an error. Therefore, labeling it as ""enhancement"" seems appropriate because it's enhancing the functionality by improving diagnostics.

Related #65612.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""internal"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on the provided information. Let me break down what's happening here.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it seems to be about changes made to a codebase, specifically modifying files related to version handling in Go. The patches involve functions like FileVersions, Lang, AtLeast, Before, and so on. These are internal details of how versions are managed within the tool or library.

The body of the report includes several commits that adjust how Go versions are determined. For example, there's a shift from using info.FileVersions to a new function FileVersion, which uses a toolchain version when built with Go <=1.21. There's also testing added for AtLeast and Before functions, indicating these are internal utilities.

The patches modify internal package structures, test cases, and utility functions. They don't seem to affect public APIs or user-facing features but rather the internal mechanics of version handling. The tests added (like TestFileVersions122 and TestFileVersions121) are unit tests for these internal functions, which further suggests this is an internal change.

The label ""internal"" typically refers to issues that pertain to the inner workings of a project, not directly exposed to end-users or external developers. Since all the changes here are about how versions are internally tracked and compared within the tool, it fits under the internal category.

So yes, the ""internal"" label accurately reflects this issue as it's dealing with the project's internal version management.

See my original debugging journey at <URL>

Perhaps related to <URL> in terms of HTML entity encoding causing the issue.

When you have a template with enough elements with props on them, i.e:

```The code snippet is a Vue.js composition API script setup with TypeScript. It defines an array `includedFeatures` containing string values. The template renders a nested `div` structure with an `img` tag inside the main element.```

It [passes a threshold in Vue's compiler to compile the template as a ""static"" VNode](<URL>

```The code defines a Vue component named `index` that returns a main element with a German language attribute and contains a static div structure with an image. It uses Vue's composition API and template literal strings for class names and HTML attributes.```

However, if we have a valid Tailwind class in there:

```The code snippet shows a comparison between two versions of an HTML `div` element. The first version contains an inner `div`, while the second uses the `::after` pseudo-element to insert content.```

Then Vue compiles it to (snipped for brevity):

```The code snippet returns a function that generates JSX-like markup for a main element containing a static div with an img tag, using cache optimization.```
Notice the `after:content-[&#39;&#39;]`. Since this is a module in Vite's module graph, this gets scanned for class candidates by Tailwind. It sees `after:content-[&#39;&#39;]` as a valid class and generates a rule for it:

```The CSS snippet defines a selector `.after:content-['']` with an `::after` pseudo-element that uses custom properties to set and then use the `content` property. The `--tw-content` custom property is initially set to an empty string and then used in the `content` declaration.```
And then when the default PostCSS pipeline in Nuxt runs on this, it errors out:
```The log indicates an error during the Nuxt build process using Vite and PostCSS. The error is an ""Unknown word"" at line 128, character 24 of the `main.css` file located in the `assets/css` directory. The error originates from the PostCSS parser and provides a traceback of the parsing process that led to the issue.```

Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if the label ""template"" accurately reflects an issue report based on the provided code changes. The user has given a lot of code context and patches, so I need to analyze that to figure out what's going on.

First, let me read through the code changes. It looks like there are significant modifications in several files related to a Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS. The main areas affected seem to be around how dependencies are handled during builds, especially regarding when a rebuild is necessary and how build artifacts are managed.

Looking at the patches, I see that the constructor of the `Root` class has been modified. Previously, it was taking in several parameters including `requiresRebuild`, but now that's been removed. Instead, there's a new method called `requiresBuild()` which seems to check if any dependencies have changed by comparing their last modification times. This suggests that the rebuild logic is being made more efficient or accurate.

There are also changes in how build dependencies are tracked. The class now uses a `Map` to keep track of file paths and their modification times, and there's an `addBuildDependency` method that updates this map. This seems like it's part of an effort to correctly determine when a rebuild is necessary by monitoring these timestamps.

Another significant change is in the `generate` method of the `Root` class. The code now checks if the build requires rebuilding using `requiresBuildPromise`, and if so, it clears out the old dependencies and reinitializes the compiler and scanner. This indicates that the way dependencies are handled has been overhauled to be more precise.

I also notice that some methods have been renamed or repurposed, such as `sharedCandidates` being removed in favor of directly using a set of candidates. The comments suggest that this is part of optimizing how the build process detects changes and avoids unnecessary rebuilds.

Putting all this together, it seems like the main focus of these code changes is on improving the efficiency and correctness of dependency handling and the build process for the Vite plugin. The modifications ensure that the plugin only triggers rebuilds when necessary by accurately tracking file changes, which can improve performance during development and production builds.

Now, considering the label ""template"" assigned to this issue. From what I understand, a template issue usually relates to generating files or code snippets based on certain conditions, perhaps using templates in configuration files or code generation features. However, looking at these changes, they don't seem to involve any templating mechanisms. Instead, they're about optimizing the build and dependency system.

Therefore, the label ""template"" doesn't accurately reflect the nature of this issue report. The issue is more about enhancing the build process efficiency rather than anything related to templates or code generation.
</think>

The label ""template"" does not accurately reflect the issue based on the provided code changes. These changes focus on optimizing dependency handling and rebuild logic, which are unrelated to templating.

Alright, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""complex numbers"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""RuntimeError: 'fill_empty_deterministic_' not implemented for 'ComplexHalf'"". The error message mentions 'ComplexHalf', which I know refers to a complex number type with half-precision floating points in PyTorch. So right away, it's related to complex numbers.

The body of the issue describes the bug as a RuntimeError occurring when trying to use 'fill_empty_deterministic_' on a 'ComplexHalf' tensor. The error logs are the same as the title, reinforcing that this is about an unimplemented method for a specific data type involving complex numbers.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

In Patch 1, there's a change in the AT_DISPATCH_V2 macro where they added 'kComplexHalf' to the list of types. This suggests that before the patch, 'ComplexHalf' wasn't handled by this function, leading to the runtime error. The addition means the function now supports complex half-precision numbers.

Patch 2 modifies a test case by adding 'torch.complex32' to the list of data types being tested. This indicates that they're expanding their tests to include complex number types, which aligns with fixing issues related to them.

The assigned label is ""complex numbers"". Given all these points—the error message specifically mentions 'ComplexHalf', the patches add support for this type in both the function and test cases—it's clear that the issue revolves around handling complex numbers in PyTorch. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem described.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""distributed"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""[DSD] keep 'exp_avg' as DTensor after `torch.distributed.checkpoint.state_dict.set_optimizer_state_dict`"". The mention of ""torch.distributed"" immediately suggests that this is related to distributed training in PyTorch. DSD might stand for Distributed Software Development or something else, but the key here is the use of torch.distributed functions.

Next, I'll examine the body of the issue. It includes a code snippet that uses `torch.distributed` modules like `dist.init_process_group`, `fully_shard`, and functions from `torch.distributed.checkpoint`. The code sets up a distributed environment with multiple processes and uses FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism), which is part of PyTorch's distributed training features. The issue seems to be about ensuring that certain tensors ('exp_avg') remain as DTensors after checkpointing, which relates to how state is managed in distributed training.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

1. Patch 1 adds a new test case within a test class. The test involves initializing a process group, creating a model with fully sharded layers, and checking if the optimizer's state ('exp_avg') remains a DTensor after getting and setting the optimizer state dictionary using `torch.distributed.checkpoint` functions. This is clearly testing distributed behavior.

2. Patch 2 introduces two new functions: `_distribute_tensors` and `_distribute_state_dict`. These functions handle distributing tensors across processes, which is core to distributed training. They check process groups and ensure that the state dictionaries are correctly managed across different ranks.

3. Patch 3 modifies the function `_load_optim_state_dict`. It adds a conditional check for `info.full_state_dict` and decides whether to broadcast or distribute the state dictionary. This directly ties into how state is handled in a distributed setup, ensuring each process gets the correct part of the state.

All these patches are modifications within files related to distributed training, specifically dealing with checkpointing and optimizer state management. The functions and tests added are part of PyTorch's distributed module, which confirms that this issue pertains to the 'distributed' label.

Therefore, the label ""distributed"" is appropriate because all aspects of the issue—title, body, and patches—are focused on functionalities within PyTorch's distributed training framework.
</think>

The label ""distributed"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves modifications to distributed training components in PyTorch.

golang/go,69940,hashing,hash/maphash: purego implementation is not updated,"According to lines 33 & 34 of `hash/maphash/maphash_purego.go`:
```This code snippet is a port of the `wyhash` implementation from `runtime/hash64.go`, specifically designed to be written in pure Go without using `unsafe`.```

However, when I look to the effective code inside this file, the implementation looks very different from the one in `runtime/hash64.go`, and I think it should be changed to match it accordingly.

Among the differences:
1. In the `runtime/hash64.go`, the variable hashkey is used often, but it's totally absent from the `maphash_purego.go` implementation. This is a [4]uint64 array that contains random values, generated during the package initialization inside `runtime/alg.go`. I think an `init()` function should be added to the `maphash_purego.go` file to generate random uint64 in a private global variable, similar to the hashkey one.
2. On April 2024 (6 months ago), hash64.go implementation has been updated, in commits ef2f3391da20e4aca689033045c0d00fddd0b190 and 35c619398b976bf90fb8c813653cf48ce732b032, now the global hashkey variable is used even more (should we add an equivalent in maphash too? Related to point 1) and 4 out of 5 constants have been removed, these changes are currently missing from the `hashmap_purego.go` implementation.
3.  Although the comments says the the code afterward is just a porting from `hash64.go`, the code structure looks very different. For example: the default case of the hash64 implementation, in this implementation is written before the whole switch, and a lot of cases are grouped under a new default case. Maybe these differences are correct, but there is no documentation to explain them, and I don't understand why they are not directly part of `runtime/hash64.go` too if the code does the same thing?

First, looking at the title: ""hash/maphash: purego implementation is not updated."" This clearly indicates that the issue pertains to a problem with the hash implementation in the maphash package. The term ""purego"" suggests it's about a Go implementation without using unsafe code.

Next, examining the body of the issue. It mentions discrepancies between the `maphash_purego.go` file and the `runtime/hash64.go`, specifically regarding the use of `hashkey`, constants, and code structure differences. The reporter points out that the purego implementation hasn't been updated to match recent changes in `hash64.go`, which could affect its correctness or performance.

The patches provided show several key changes. They introduce a global `hashkey` variable initialized via an `init()` function, replacing constants like `m1`, `m2`, etc., with references to `hashkey[0]`, `hashkey[1]`, and so on. This aligns the purego implementation more closely with `runtime/hash64.go`, where `hashkey` is used extensively.

Considering all these elements—the title, body, and patches—all revolve around updating a hashing function's implementation to match another part of the codebase. The changes are technical and specific to how hashing is computed in Go. 

The label ""hashing"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to issues concerning hash functions, their implementations, and optimizations. It categorizes the problem under a relevant and specific area, making it easier for contributors or users to identify and address similar issues.

I don't see any aspects of the issue that would fall outside of hashing concerns. The changes are about aligning the purego implementation with another part of the codebase related to hash functions. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the content of the issue report.
</think>

The label ""hashing"" is appropriate as it directly relates to the issue's focus on updating a hash function's implementation.

angular/angular,56290,bug,ComponentFixture.whenStable doesn't detect event emitted from async output in zoneless CD,"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?

core

### Is this a regression?

No

### Description

In zoneless mode (i.e. with `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()`), a test using autoDetectChanges does not detect the changes caused by the emission of an event by a child output using an async EventEmitter (i.e. `new EventEmitter(true)`).

To make things clearer, use the minimal reproduction (see below), and execute the following commands in the terminal:

- `cd app`
- `npm install`
- `ng serve`

Note at this point that clicking the two buttons works as expected: the associated ""hello"" message becomes ""world"".

Now run `ng test`.

The test for the ""Async"" section fails. The difference between the first and the second section is that the first one reacts to a sync output from the child component, whereas the second one reacts to an async output.

Using async outputs might seem weird (BTW, this option deoesn't exist with the new `output()` function), but this issue comes from a real use-case where it is actually used (ng-bootstrap's pagination component).

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the provided patches. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""ComponentFixture.whenStable doesn't detect event emitted from async output in zoneless CD"". This clearly indicates an issue where a test fixture isn't detecting events as expected when using asynchronous outputs in a specific change detection mode (zoneless). That sounds like unexpected behavior, which is typically classified as a bug.

Next, the body of the issue describes that in zoneless mode with autoDetectChanges, a test fails to detect changes caused by an async EventEmitter. The user provided steps to reproduce and a minimal example, along with environment details. They also mentioned it's not a regression but comes from a real use-case (ng-bootstrap's pagination). All these points support the idea that this is a bug rather than a feature request or other issue type.

Now, examining the patches. There are multiple code changes across different files. The main changes involve modifying how EventEmitter handles async operations by integrating with PendingTasks to track tasks and ensure proper cleanup. Additionally, there's a test added to verify app stability when emitting events asynchronously. These patches are addressing the root cause of the issue, which is about event detection not working as intended in specific scenarios—clearly a bug fix.

Considering all these aspects—the title indicating unexpected behavior, the body detailing a reproducible problem, and the patches fixing underlying issues—it's evident that the label ""bug"" is appropriate here. There's no indication that this is an enhancement, feature request, or documentation issue.

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it describes unexpected behavior with provided reproduction steps and patches addressing the root cause.

microsoft/vscode,223349,configuration,Configuring a non-existing browser alias fails silently,"Testing #220989

Not sure if this is possible, but I set the `workbench.externalBrowser` to `firefox` even though I don't have Firefox... then I tried to open something and nothing happened. I was confused because I thought I had Firefox installed, but I guess I remembered incorrectly!

I think something like this is increasingly important in the workspace-setting level. Sure, the protection of this is behind Workspace Trust... but I don't seem to get any notification or indication that there's a setting applied that influences how VS Code opens the browser or if it's going to no-op.

Considering this setting influences things like user auth flows, I think we should try to do something here. I was surprised that no browser was opened when I attempted to log in to a GitHub extension... which makes sense if this setting is set to something invalid.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the provided information carefully.

First, the title of the issue is ""Configuring a non-existing browser alias fails silently."" That immediately tells me that the problem is related to how a configuration setting (specifically for an external browser) behaves when it's set incorrectly. The user tried setting `workbench.externalBrowser` to 'firefox' even though they didn't have Firefox installed, and nothing happened without any notifications.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user describes their experience where they expected some indication that the browser wasn't available but got none. They mention the importance of this in workspace settings and how it affects things like authentication flows, which makes sense because if a browser isn't properly set up, those processes can break without any feedback.

Now, moving on to the patches provided. The code changes are in the `openExternalBrowser` method. They added error handling where if the configured browser fails to open the URL, it falls back to using the default application by calling `shell.openExternal(url)`. This means that when the specified browser isn't found or can't be opened, VS Code now tries to open the URL with whatever default is set up on the system. Additionally, they modified the error logging to include a message about the failure.

The key here is that these changes address how the configuration of the external browser is handled. They improve the fallback mechanism and provide better feedback (through logs) when the configured browser isn't available or doesn't work as expected.

So, considering all this, the issue revolves around how the application handles configuration settings for external browsers. The problem was a silent failure when an invalid configuration was set, leading to no feedback for the user. The solution involves enhancing error handling and fallback mechanisms related to these configurations.

Therefore, the label ""configuration"" accurately captures the essence of the issue because it's all about how the application deals with user-configured settings, specifically the external browser alias in this case.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""x/exp/typeparams: TestAPIConsistency fail with Go tip since CL 575455."" The key points here are that a test (TestAPIConsistency) started failing after a specific change list (CL 575455). This suggests that something broke because of that change.

Now, the body of the issue provides more details. It mentions that the failure is consistent and includes a link to the CI results. The error messages indicate that certain methods like ""*TypeList.Types"" are returning different types in Go 1.18+ compared to 1.17. Specifically, they're returning Seq types which aren't supported in 1.17.

The patches applied to fix this issue added a condition to skip checking certain APIs if they involve ""Seq"" and aren't present in 1.17. This means the test was failing because it expected these methods to behave a certain way across versions, but they don't because of changes introduced after CL 575455.

Putting this together, the problem started after a particular change (CL 575455) which caused a test failure. The fix involved adjusting the test to ignore cases that weren't compatible with older Go versions. This is a classic case of a regression where a change introduces a bug or causes a previously passing test to fail.

So yes, ""regression"" accurately reflects this issue because it was introduced by a specific change and caused a test failure.
</think>

The label ""regression"" is appropriate here as the issue arose due to a specific change that caused a test failure.

rust-lang/rust,126789,warning,`#[used]` attribute on static items in `extern` block has suboptimal error message,"### Code

```This Rust code snippet declares a C-compatible extern static variable `FOO` with type `i32`, marked with the `#[used]` attribute to ensure it is included in the binary.```


### Current output

`````The code snippet indicates an error where the `#[used]` attribute is being applied to a non-static variable, which is not allowed. The error message points to line 2 in `src/lib.rs`, specifically at the `#[used]` attribute.```


### Desired output

There should be at least a hint, or other kind of diagnostic message, explaining _why_ `#[used]` attribute is invalid in this context.


### Rationale and extra context

`#[used]` attribute cannot be applied to static items defined inside `extern` blocks. However current compiler error, contrary to great Rust standards, does not explain _why_ it is forbidden, or how to fix it. Moreover it can be confusing to newbie users. To the information ""attribute must be applied to a `static` variable"", one could say ""But it is static. Look, it says it right there"".

I would expect a hint, or another diagnostic that would explain that the `#[used]` attribute is used on static items that are defined _inside_ crate, and `extern` blocks are used to declare an item, that exists elsewhere. Using this attribute inside `extern` block means that user either does not understand how `#[used]` attribute works, or how `extern` blocks work and a hint pointing it out to them could be helpful.

This would also be more inline with other errors related to incorrectly using static items inside `extern` blocks. For example assigning value to such static will result in following error message:

```This Rust code snippet declares a static C-compatible variable `FOO` with the value `42`. The `extern ""C""` attribute indicates that this variable follows C linkage rules.```

`````````The code attempts to define a static variable `FOO` with an initializer inside an `extern` block, which is not allowed. Static variables defined within an `extern` block must not have initializers.```

Here compiler provides also notes, explaining why this code does not work and directs user to documentation that could be useful in this context.

### Other cases

A similar case could be made for the `#[no_mangle]` attribute. Using it on static item in `extern` block produces following warning (which will become error in the future):

```This Rust code snippet declares an external C static variable `FOO` with type `i32`, and ensures it is not mangled during compilation.```

```````The log shows a warning about the `#[no_mangle]` attribute having no effect on a foreign static in `src/lib.rs` at line 2. The compiler suggests removing the attribute and notes that this feature will become a hard error in a future release. The warning also mentions that symbol names in extern blocks are not mangled and that the `#[warn(unused_attributes)]` is enabled by default.```

[The Rust Reference](<URL> says that `#[no_mangle]` implies `#[used]`:

> Additionally, the item will be publicly exported from the produced library or object file, similar to the used attribute.

Therefore using this attribute can be caused by the same fallacy - user not understanding that `extern` blocks refer to, well, _external_ items, and not to those that are exported from their crate. Adding similar hint to this warning (and future error) could also help users making this error.

PS. Actually the same argument could be made for other [ABI attributes](<URL> like `#[link_section]` and `#[export_name]`.

### Rust Version

```The log indicates that the Rust compiler version is 1.79.0, built on June 10, 2024, with commit hash 129f3b996. It is running on an x86_64 Linux system and uses LLVM version 18.1.7.```


### Anything else?

_No response_








",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""warning"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue title says that using `#[used]` on a static item in an extern block gives a suboptimal error message. The user provided code where `#[used]` is applied inside an extern block, and the current compiler output doesn't explain why it's invalid, which could confuse users. They suggest adding hints or more detailed diagnostics to clarify.

Looking at the patches, I see that the error messages were updated. For example, one patch adds a note saying ""but this is a foreign static item."" Another patch modifies the code to include more specific errors with labels. The patches are about improving error messages, not about warnings.

The issue isn't about introducing a warning but rather enhancing an existing error message to be more informative. So, the label should reflect that it's an error handling or diagnostics improvement, not a warning. Therefore, the ""warning"" label doesn't fit because the problem is with the error message quality, not a warning being issued.
</think>

The issue concerns improving an error message, so the correct label should relate to errors or diagnostics, not warnings.

Okay, let's try to figure out if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue.

First, looking at the title: it mentions failures on Windows with a specific error about a process not accessing a file because it's being used by another process. So the problem seems related to file handling or concurrency issues on Windows.

The body of the issue includes a watchflakes query, which is used to monitor test flakes in Go. The example log shows a failure in TestGoToTypeDefinition_Issue60544, where the error occurs when trying to remove files in the sandbox. The error message is about not being able to access the file because it's in use.

Now looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 and Patch 2 update dependencies, specifically golang.org/x/mod from v0.15.1 to v0.16.0 and golang.org/x/telemetry to a newer version. This suggests they might be updating libraries to fix compatibility issues or bugs related to file handling.

Patch 3 modifies the uploadReportContents function. It adds logic to remove a file if the server responds with a 4xx error, which could prevent files from being left in an inconsistent state that causes the ""file in use"" error.

Patches 4 and 5 adjust how telemetry directories are handled. They introduce a TelemetryDir config option and modify where telemetry data is stored. This could help isolate processes or ensure that temporary files are managed correctly, preventing file locks.

Putting it all together, the issue seems to be about the program not being able to clean up files because they're still in use, which points to issues with resource management or concurrency. The patches aim to fix this by better handling file cleanup and adjusting how directories are used, possibly avoiding file lock contention.

The term ""runtime error"" usually refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as type errors, null pointer exceptions, etc. However, in Go, it can also refer to issues related to concurrency or system calls. The problem here is more about resource management and file handling rather than a typical runtime error like a panic or crash due to incorrect memory access.

Therefore, while the issue does involve an error occurring at runtime, labeling it as ""runtime error"" might be too broad or misleading. It's more specifically related to file handling or concurrency issues on Windows. So I'm not sure if ""runtime error"" is the most accurate label here.
</think>

The issue revolves around file access errors during cleanup due to files being in use, which relates to resource management and concurrency rather than a general runtime error. The patches focus on improving file handling and telemetry setup.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""runtime error"" was correctly applied to a particular issue report. The question is asking if this label accurately reflects the issue based on its title, body, and any patches made in the repository to fix it.

First, I should understand what a runtime error typically refers to. Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program and are usually due to issues that weren't caught at compile time. Examples include null pointer exceptions, division by zero, or out-of-bounds array access.

Now, looking at the provided code snippet, it seems to be part of a web-based visualization tool using D3.js for charts. The functions include rendering elements like rectangles with certain attributes and handling events like clicks and DOM manipulations.

I notice that there's an event listener added for ""click"" events on document.querySelectorAll("".js-tooltip""). Inside the listener, it checks if the click is within the element using this.el.contains(n.target). If not, it removes the ""open"" attribute from this.el. This could be a tooltip feature where clicking outside closes the tooltip.

Another part of the code sets up an event listener for ""click"" on h2 elements to toggle sections in local storage and update the UI accordingly. There's also some chart initialization using Page.Charts.Programs, which might involve fetching data and rendering it with D3.js marks.

I don't immediately see any obvious runtime errors in this snippet. However, potential issues could arise from:

1. DOM manipulation: Accessing elements that might not exist (e.g., document.querySelector(""html"") or "".js-selectConfig"" might return null if the element isn't present).
2. Event listeners: Attaching multiple listeners without proper cleanup can cause memory leaks.
3. Local storage: Using localStorage without error handling could lead to exceptions, especially in browsers where it's disabled.
4. Data processing: The charts might throw errors if data is malformed or missing.

The code also includes a setTimeout function (E3), which debounces some UI updates. If the timeout isn't properly cleared, it could cause unintended behavior.

However, without specific error messages or more context about the issue report itself, it's hard to say definitively. The presence of certain practices that could lead to runtime errors suggests that ""runtime error"" might be a fitting label if the reported issue was indeed caused by such problems during execution.
</think>

The code provided doesn't show explicit runtime errors but includes elements that could potentially cause them, like DOM element access and event handling without proper checks. If the issue report involved such execution-time problems, then yes.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42242,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to SnakeYAML 2.3,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to SnakeYAML 2.3"". That clearly suggests that the purpose is to update a dependency, specifically SnakeYAML, from an older version to version 2.3.

The body of the issue is empty, which means there's no additional context provided beyond the title. But the patches made can give more insight into what changes were done to resolve the issue.

Looking at Patch 1, it shows a change in the snakeYamlVersion from 2.2 to 2.3. This indicates that the dependency version was indeed upgraded. There are no other lines changed in this patch, so it's solely focused on updating the SnakeYAML version.

Now, considering the label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Since both the title and the patch directly relate to upgrading a dependency, the label seems appropriate. The action taken matches the label, as it's about increasing the version of an existing library the project depends on.

I don't see any information that would suggest this isn't a dependency upgrade. There's no mention of new features or bug fixes outside of updating the version number, which is typical for such issues. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" correctly describes an issue where the SnakeYAML library was updated from 2.2 to 2.3.

The stack trace points to issues within the Go runtime's map handling functions, specifically in `moveToBmap`, `mapclone2`, and `clone`.```

### What did you expect to see?

No crash.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""maps: segmentation violation in maps.Clone"". A segmentation violation typically indicates a runtime error because it's related to memory access issues, which are usually detected during execution.

Next, the body describes a test case where a Go program crashes with a SIGSEGV signal, which is a segmentation fault. This is a clear sign of a runtime error since it's happening when the code runs, not at compile time or due to logical errors.

The stack trace provided points to a problem in the `mapclone2` function within the Go runtime. The issue arises during the cloning of a map, which suggests that there's an underlying problem with how maps are handled internally, leading to memory corruption or invalid access.

Looking at the patches, they modify functions related to map cloning and bucket management. They adjust how the destination map is created when cloning, ensuring that it doesn't exceed certain limits to prevent crashes. This indicates a fix for a runtime behavior, specifically preventing segmentation violations during map operations.

The test case added in Patch 3 seems designed to trigger the same conditions that caused the crash, focusing on same-size grow scenarios which were problematic. The use of `unsafe` and linking to internal functions further suggests it's testing low-level runtime behavior.

Since all these elements point to an issue that causes the program to crash due to memory access issues during execution, the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the problem described.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title of the issue is ""High CPU usage under WSL even when vscode is idle."" That immediately tells me that there's a problem with VS Code consuming more CPU than expected, specifically in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment, even when it's not actively being used. The user provided steps to reproduce this by opening VS Code in WSL and monitoring the CPU usage with tools like htop.

In the body of the issue, they mention that the expected behavior is for CPU usage to be around 0% when idle, but what actually happens is the CPU stays between 2-10%. They also provided detailed system information, including versions of VS Code, OS, and WSL, as well as extensions installed. This indicates that it's a problem they're encountering consistently under these specific conditions.

Now, looking at the patches provided to resolve this issue, they seem to modify some configuration settings related to remote connections in VS Code. Specifically, there are changes to the descriptions of 'remote.autoForwardPorts' and 'remote.autoForwardPortsSource'. The markdown descriptions have been updated to include additional information about how ports are forwarded when these settings are enabled or disabled. 

Hmm, so I'm trying to connect how this patch relates to the high CPU usage issue. Maybe these configuration changes affect background processes that handle port forwarding, which could be contributing to increased CPU usage when VS Code is idle. If the automatic port forwarding was overly aggressive before, perhaps it was causing unnecessary CPU activity even when the application wasn't active.

The label assigned is ""bug."" A bug typically refers to an unintended behavior in the software that causes it to malfunction or perform incorrectly. In this case, high CPU usage when the application should be idle could indeed be a bug because it's not the expected behavior, and it's causing performance issues for the user.

I think the label accurately reflects the issue because the problem is about unexpected behavior (high CPU usage) that isn't aligned with normal expectations (low CPU when idle). The patches made to the configuration settings likely address this by changing how ports are handled, which might reduce unnecessary CPU activity. Therefore, labeling it as a bug makes sense.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue because it describes unexpected behavior causing performance issues, addressed by relevant configuration changes.

**bug**
Inspect the Dom tree. There will be two  `inline-chat-overflow` nodes, one of which should have been cleaned up when the editor group closed

Here's where the node is created: <URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""cleanup"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's start by looking at the title: ""Inline chat inline-chat-overflow nodes not cleaned up."" The word ""cleaned"" is right there, which suggests that something isn't being removed properly.

Moving on to the body of the issue, it describes a scenario where opening and closing editor groups leaves behind extra `inline-chat-overflow` nodes. Specifically, after closing the second editor group, two such nodes remain instead of one. The bug here is that these nodes aren't being cleaned up as they should when an editor group closes.

Now looking at the patches made to fix this issue. In the code, a variable `overflowWidgetsNode` is created by appending a DOM element. Then, in the constructor, a disposable is added to remove this node when it's no longer needed. This ensures that every time an instance of the widget is destroyed, its corresponding overflow node gets cleaned up.

So the problem was that these nodes weren't being removed, leading to extra elements in the DOM tree. The fix involves adding code to specifically clean up by removing the node when the widget is disposed. Therefore, the issue is indeed about cleaning up leftover nodes, which aligns perfectly with the ""cleanup"" label.

I don't see any other aspects like performance or UI changes here; it's purely about ensuring proper cleanup of elements that should be temporary. So yes, the label fits.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43081,internal,Use internal attributes for values that aren't directly referenced in .adoc files,Forward port of issue #43080 to 3.4.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""internal"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Use internal attributes for values that aren't directly referenced in .adoc files."" That sounds like they're changing how certain attributes are handled, specifically moving some to be internal rather than exposed elsewhere. So maybe this is about refactoring code to use more internal variables or methods instead of external ones.

Next, the body says it's a forward port of issue #43080 to 3.4.x. That suggests that this fix or change was already made in another branch and now they're applying it to the 3.4.x branch. So it's related to maintaining consistency across versions.

Now looking at the patches provided, there are three patches. Let me go through each one to understand what changes were made.

Patch 1: It seems to modify a method called addVersionAttributes. They added an internal map and changed how attributes are added. Instead of putting everything into the main attributes map, they're now using an internal map for some values. For example, lines where it used to put ""version-"" prefixes now use ""antoraversion-"" and ""dotxversion-"". Also, in addPropertyAttributes, there's a new resolve method that replaces placeholders using the internal map. This indicates that certain attributes are being kept internal and not directly exposed.

Patch 2: This changes URLs in some .adoc files. They're replacing placeholders like {version-spring-data-cassandra-javadoc} with {dotxversion-spring-data-cassandra}. So they're updating how version references are handled, probably to use the new internal attributes instead of the old ones. It looks like they're ensuring that the URLs point correctly using these new internal versions.

Patch 3: There are test cases here. They check if certain version entries exist in the attributes. The tests now expect ""version-spring-data-mongodb"" and specific URL formats, which align with the changes made in Patch 1. This shows that they're verifying the internal attributes are correctly set and used in URLs.

Putting this all together, the main change is moving certain attributes to be internal so they aren't directly referenced in .adoc files anymore. The code now uses these internal attributes for versioning and URL construction, which makes sense as per the title of the issue. 

The label ""internal"" seems appropriate because the changes are about handling internal attributes rather than external or public ones. They're refactoring how data is managed within the code without exposing those details to the end user or other external systems.

I don't see any parts where this change would affect external functionality directly; it's more about internal code organization and efficiency. So, yes, the ""internal"" label accurately reflects the nature of this issue.
</think>

spring-projects/spring-boot,39157,forward port,Polish reference documentation,Forward port of issue #38942 to 3.3.x.,0,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the issue title: ""Polish reference documentation."" This suggests that the main goal is to improve or refine the documentation, possibly for clarity or correctness. The word ""polish"" implies making something smoother or more professional.

Next, the body of the issue says: ""Forward port of issue #38942 to 3.3.x."" A forward port typically refers to taking changes from one branch (often a feature or fix) and applying them to another branch, usually a newer or different version. So this indicates that whatever was done in issue #38942 is being moved into the 3.3.x branch.

Now, looking at the patches provided. There are seven patches, each modifying documentation files. For example:

- Patch 1 changes a line about Job beans in Spring Batch configuration.
- Patch 2 adjusts wording related to Hibernate DDL settings.
- Patches 3 through 7 make similar minor adjustments in different sections of the documentation.

All these changes seem to be about improving the clarity, grammar, or accuracy of the reference documentation. They don't add new features but refine existing content.

The term ""forward port"" is often used in software development when code changes are merged from one branch into another. However, in this case, the patches aren't moving code changes between branches; they're updating documentation. So while the issue mentions a forward port, the actual work done doesn't fit the typical understanding of that term because it's about documentation, not code.

Therefore, labeling this as ""forward port"" might be misleading since the primary action is documentation polishing rather than merging code between branches. The label should reflect the true nature of the changes made.
</think>

The issue is primarily about improving documentation rather than moving code changes between branches. Thus, the label doesn't accurately represent the work done.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""configuration"" correctly reflects the issue report described here. Let's start by looking at what the problem is about.

From the initial description, it seems that there was an issue with how Deno handles adding packages when a `package.json` file exists but not a `deno.json`. The problem arises because Deno prioritizes `package.json`, which isn't intended. The solution involved modifying Deno's code to check for a `deno.json` first and only create or update it, ignoring `package.json`.

Now, looking at the patches provided, they primarily deal with changes in how dependencies are managed between `package.json` and `deno.json`. For example, Patch 4 modifies the Cargo.toml file, which is related to Rust dependencies, but that might be a red herring. The other patches like 5 through 19 show various test cases and expected outputs dealing with adding and removing packages, which directly relate to configuration files.

The key here is understanding what ""configuration"" as a label implies. Configuration typically involves how settings or preferences are managed within the application. In this case, Deno's behavior when handling different configuration files (package.json vs deno.json) is central to the issue. The patches adjust how Deno interacts with these files, ensuring that `deno.json` is prioritized and correctly updated without affecting `package.json`.

Therefore, since the problem revolves around the management and interaction of configuration files, the label ""configuration"" seems appropriate.

pytorch/pytorch,121091,complex numbers,Spectral Norm doesn't appear to work on complex-valued networks,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

The spectral norm (referring to the implementation in <URL> but applies likely to old implementation in `spectral_norm.py` as well) doesn't appear to work on complex-valued networks.

```This code snippet defines a function `sanity_check_spectral_norm` to verify the correct computation of spectral normalization for a simple diagonal weight matrix. It checks the function for floating-point and complex floating-point dtypes, noting that it fails for the complex type.```
Perhaps the implementation is not intended to support complex-valued transformations. However, the power iteration method does apply to complex numbers.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""complex numbers"" is appropriate for the given GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Spectral Norm doesn't appear to work on complex-valued networks."" This immediately tells me that the problem is related to how spectral norm is handling complex numbers in neural networks. So the issue is specifically about complex-valued tensors or networks, which suggests that ""complex numbers"" would be a relevant label.

Next, I read the body of the issue. The user provided code examples where they test the spectral norm implementation with both float and complex floats (cfloat). They noticed that while it works for floats, it fails when using complex-valued tensors. This reinforces that the problem is tied to handling complex numbers in the spectral norm function.

The user also mentions that even though the power iteration method applies to complex numbers, the current implementation might not support them. They're suggesting that the issue arises because of how the code treats complex values differently than float values.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies a test case to include both float and cfloat types. It adjusts the expected outcome by using the absolute value of the diagonal elements before scaling, which is necessary for complex numbers since they can have both real and imaginary parts. This change ensures that the spectral norm works correctly for complex-valued weights.

Patch 2 changes how the matrix multiplication is handled in the power method. Instead of using transpose (t()), it uses Hermitian transpose (H), which is appropriate for complex matrices. The dot product was also replaced with vdot, which handles complex vectors correctly by taking the conjugate inner product.

Both patches address issues specific to handling complex numbers in the spectral norm computation. They ensure that operations like matrix multiplication and normalization are correctly applied when dealing with complex-valued tensors.

Putting it all together: the issue is about the spectral norm not functioning as expected on networks using complex values, which the patches specifically target by adjusting how these complex numbers are processed during the power iterations and normalization steps.

Therefore, the label ""complex numbers"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue. It directly addresses a problem arising from handling complex-valued data in the spectral norm implementation.
</think>

The label ""complex numbers"" is appropriate as it directly relates to the issue with spectral norm on complex-valued networks and the patches addressing these specific handling issues.

",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""lightning: when tidb.tls config set to 'false', TLSConfig didn't change, and db cannot connect."" This immediately tells me that the problem is related to a configuration setting in TiDB Lightning. The user is having trouble because setting `tidb.tls` to ""false"" isn't working as expected—it’s not changing the TLS configuration, which causes a connection issue.

Next, I'll look at the body of the report. Under the bug section, the user provided steps to reproduce the problem, which involves modifying the `lightning.toml` file and setting `[tidb.tls]` to ""false"". They expected the database connection to work but instead encountered an error about TLS not being supported by the server despite the client requesting it. The user also pointed out specific lines in the code where they believe the issue might be, which relates to how TLS configurations are handled when `tidb.tls` is set to ""false"".

Now, examining the patches provided: 

In Patch 1, changes were made to the `adjust` function in the DBStore struct. It looks like this function handles different TLS settings based on the configuration. Previously, when `d.TLS` was set to """" or ""false"", it just assigned `d.TLS = ""false""` without resetting other security configurations. The patch updated this case so that when `tidb.tls` is set to ""false"" or an empty string, all related TLSConfig fields (like CAPath, CertPath, KeyPath, etc.) are reset to nil or empty strings. This means the configuration correctly reflects the user's intention to disable TLS.

Patch 2 modifies a test case in TestAdjustSecuritySection. It adds new test scenarios where `tidb.tls` is set to ""false"" and ensures that the expected behavior (no TLS, etc.) is validated. This shows that the issue was not just about code changes but also ensuring that these changes are correctly tested, which ties back to configuration handling.

So, putting it all together: The problem arises from a misconfiguration when setting `tidb.tls` to ""false"". The patches fix how this configuration is handled in the code. The label ""configuration"" seems appropriate because the issue is directly related to how settings are applied and affect the application's behavior.

Therefore, I think the label accurately reflects the issue report.
</think>

The label ""configuration"" accurately captures the essence of the problem, which revolves around TLS configuration settings causing connection issues when set to ""false"". The patches address these configuration mishandlings, making the label appropriate.

pytorch/pytorch,118159,type system,Dynamo'd Adamax runs into TorchRuntimeError with mismatched types immutable_list vs tuple on complex params,"### 🐛 Describe the bug

When torch.compile'ing Adamax by passing through complex parameters, we run into an internal dynamo error regarding immutable_list not being tuple.

### Error logs

```The log indicates that there was a `TorchRuntimeError` when attempting to run a function using TorchDynamo. The error occurred due to an invalid argument combination for the `_foreach_addcdiv_` method. The function received four immutable lists as arguments instead of the expected tuples of tensors or a tuple of tensors with a scalar. This mismatch in argument types caused the error. The issue originated from the `adamax` implementation in the file `/data/users/janeyx/pytorch/torch/optim/adamax.py`, specifically at line 233. The log suggests enabling additional logging and verbosity for more details and provides a workaround to suppress the error and fallback to eager mode.```

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""type system"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Dynamo'd Adamax runs into TorchRuntimeError with mismatched types immutable_list vs tuple on complex params."" The key here is the mention of a type error between immutable_list and tuple. That suggests that somewhere in the code, the expected type was a tuple but an immutable list was passed instead.

Moving to the body of the issue. The user describes a bug when using torch.compile with Adamax and complex parameters. They encountered a TorchRuntimeError specifically pointing out that _foreach_addcdiv_ received arguments of type immutable_list instead of the expected tuples or tensors. This reinforces that the problem is related to type mismatches.

The error logs detail how the function expected certain types (tuples of Tensors or Scalars) but received immutable_lists instead. This clearly indicates a type system issue because the function wasn't getting the expected data types, causing it to fail.

Now, looking at the patches provided. The patch shows that some tests were being skipped due to issues with TorchDynamo and _foreach_addcdiv_. Specifically, they mention mismatched types as the reason for skipping. This implies that the problem was indeed type-related because tests were failing due to incorrect types being passed around.

The label assigned is ""type system."" Given all the information—title mentioning type mismatch, body detailing a runtime error due to wrong argument types, and patches related to test skips caused by type issues—the label seems appropriate. The issue revolves around Dynamo expecting certain data types (tuples) but receiving others (immutable lists), which falls under the type system category.

I don't see any other labels that would better fit this scenario. It's not about performance or functionality but specifically about how data types are handled and mismatched in the code execution.
</think>

The label ""type system"" accurately reflects the issue, as it pertains to a type mismatch causing a runtime error.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Runtime error for select on partitioned table with Global Index / IndexFullScan"". The presence of ""runtime error"" in the title suggests that this is indeed a runtime issue.

Next, examining the body. The user provided steps to reproduce the bug, which includes creating a table with partitions and indexes, inserting data, and then running a SELECT query. When they run the SELECT statement, they encounter an error: ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: index out of range [2] with length 2. This clearly shows that during execution (runtime), something went wrong.

The expected outcome was a successful select, but instead, there's an error. The error message specifically mentions ""index out of range,"" which indicates an issue when trying to access an index beyond its bounds during runtime.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies how restored values are decoded by adjusting the columns considered, likely fixing an indexing issue.
Patch 2 and Patch 3 seem to be test cases that replicate the problem scenario. They create a table with similar structure, insert data, and run the SELECT query to trigger the error.

These patches address the root cause of the runtime error by ensuring proper handling of indexes during scans or selects on partitioned tables.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" is appropriate because it directly relates to the issue occurring during execution when accessing data with specific queries.

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to an error occurring during query execution.

Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to SQLite JDBC 3.47.2.0"". This clearly indicates that the purpose is to update a dependency (SQLite JDBC) to a newer version, specifically from 3.47.1.0 to 3.47.2.0. That's a strong sign pointing towards a dependency upgrade.

Next, the body of the issue is very concise: ""Upgrade to [SQLite JDBC 3.47.2.0](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases/tag/3.47.2.0)."" It provides a link to the release tag on GitHub, which further confirms that this is about updating the version of the SQLite JDBC library they're using.

Now, looking at the patch provided. The code snippet shows a change in a build configuration file (likely a Gradle or similar build script). Specifically, it changes the version number from 3.47.1.0 to 3.47.2.0 for the ""SQLite JDBC"" library within the project's dependencies. This is a clear indication that the patch is meant to upgrade the dependency.

Putting it all together: The title and body explicitly mention upgrading SQLite JDBC, and the patch shows the version being updated in the build configuration. All these elements align perfectly with what a ""dependency upgrade"" entails. There are no other aspects like bug fixes or new features mentioned; it's solely focused on updating the library version.

I don't see any reason to doubt that the label is incorrect. It seems straightforward—this issue is about upgrading a dependency, so the label fits.

Okay, so I need to determine whether the label ""bug"" is accurate for this issue based on the provided information. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it's about an error when using isinstance with iterators and torch.compile. That immediately suggests that there might be a bug because the behavior isn't as expected when compiling code with Torch.

Next, I'll look at the error details provided. The user encountered a runtime error during the execution of their code. Specifically, they were trying to use isinstance on an iterator object within a function decorated with @torch.compile. The error message indicates that there was an issue with handling the type check for iterators, which suggests that Torch's compiler isn't correctly processing this kind of type check.

Then, I'll examine the patches provided. Patch 1 adds a test case where an iterator is created and checked using isinstance within a compiled function. The expected result after applying this patch would be that the function behaves as intended without errors. This implies that prior to the patch, such code would fail, which points to a bug in how Torch handles these type checks during compilation.

Patch 2 modifies the ListIterType class by adding a python_type method. This method returns the type of an iterator (like iter([])). Adding this suggests that before the patch, the compiler might not have correctly identified the type of iterators, leading to incorrect behavior or errors when such checks were performed in compiled code.

Considering all these factors: the error occurs during execution due to a problem with type checking on iterators within a compiled function. The patches address this by adding test cases and modifying how iterator types are handled. This indicates that there was indeed a bug in the original implementation of Torch's compiler, which failed to handle isinstance checks for iterators correctly.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" is appropriate because it accurately describes an unintended behavior or error in the code that needed fixing.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is accurate as the issue involves an unintended runtime error due to incorrect handling of `isinstance` with iterators in compiled functions. The patches address this by improving type checking and adding test coverage.

tailwindlabs/tailwindcss,15193,bug,[v4] Upgrade does not handle prefix for group `tw-group` → `tw:group`,"Version: v3.4.14 
Build tools: Bun
Reproduction URL: <URL>

It looks like the `group` attribute is not being targeted by the upgrade script.
When running the `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next` command it will update all the correct things except for the `tw-group` definition. 

Instructions on the reproduction repository:

1. Clone 
2. Run `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next`

Before CSS:

```This CSS code snippet uses Tailwind CSS utility classes configured in `tailwind.config.js`. It applies specific utility classes to HTML elements:

- `h1` element gets background color properties.
- `div` element is given a group class.
- `span` element is styled with text properties and group class.```

After CSS:

`````This CSS code snippet uses Tailwind CSS utilities and variants to apply styles. It imports Tailwind CSS with a custom prefix, defines dark mode variants, and adds compatibility styles for border colors. It also applies specific classes to `h1`, `div`, and `span` elements using Tailwind's utility classes.```


Am I correct in assuming that the `tw-group` should be migrated to `tw:group`? ",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""[v4] Upgrade does not handle prefix for group `tw-group` → `tw:group`"". This suggests that there's an issue with how the upgrade script is handling a specific class during migration from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4. The user reports that when running the upgrade command, the `tw-group` isn't being updated correctly.

In the body, the user provides more details. They mention that after running the upgrade command, all other parts are updated except for the `tw-group`, which stays the same. They also provide CSS examples showing that before and after the upgrade, `tw-group` remains unchanged. The user then asks if they're correct in assuming it should be migrated to `tw:group`.

Looking at the patches, I see several changes:

1. **Patch 1** adds a note about migrating prefixes for `.group` and `.peer` classes.
2. **Patches 2-4** modify tests and configurations to handle these group and peer classes correctly, ensuring they are prefixed with `tw:`.
3. **Patch 5** adjusts how legacy classes are handled, likely related to the migration.

These patches indicate that there was a missing functionality in the upgrade script regarding specific classes. The fact that the upgrade didn't modify `tw-group` as expected points to a bug—specifically, an oversight or error in the code where certain cases weren't handled properly during the migration process.

The issue is not merely a feature request or enhancement but rather something that should have worked as intended but didn't, which fits the definition of a bug. The patches correct this behavior by adding support for these classes.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40446,ci,Run system tests on GitHub Actions,,1,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if the label ""ci"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. So, the issue has a title: ""Run system tests on GitHub Actions."" The body is empty, but the patches provided are pretty detailed.

Looking at the patch, it adds a new GitHub Actions workflow file. The workflow is named ""Run System Tests,"" and it's set up to run on pushes to the 3.1.x branch. It uses a matrix strategy with Java versions 17 and 21, which means it's testing across different Java environments. There are steps to check out code, prepare the Gradle build, run system tests using Gradle, and send notifications.

So, this setup is all about configuring continuous integration (CI) because it's automating tests on a specific branch using GitHub Actions. CI typically involves automated builds and tests whenever there's a push or pull request. The fact that they're running system tests as part of the workflow fits into CI practices.

The label ""ci"" is commonly used for issues related to setting up, modifying, or fixing CI/CD pipelines. Since this issue is about adding a new test run setup on GitHub Actions, which is a CI tool, it makes sense that the label would be ""ci.""

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but based on the content of the patches and the title, ""ci"" seems appropriate because the work done is directly related to the continuous integration configuration.
</think>

The label ""ci"" accurately reflects this issue as it involves setting up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated system tests, which falls under CI practices.

golang/go,66261,internal,cmd/compile: internal compiler error: 'TestEnv': value generic.t1 (v164) incorrectly live at entry,"### Go version

go version devel go1.23-a18aa0e3d1 Mon Mar 11 19:54:31 2024 +0000 windows/amd64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```This code snippet sets various environment variables for the Go programming language on a Windows system, including paths, build flags, and toolchain information.```


### What did you do?

I ran the testcases for <URL> using gotip

```The code snippet runs a specific Go test using the `gotip` command, targeting tests that match the `TestEnv` name and searches for them in the current directory (`.\...`).```

### What did you see happen?

The test bails out with an internal compiler error:

```The log indicates an internal compiler error during the execution of tests for the `iooption` package from the `fp-go` repository. Specifically, the error occurs at line 68 of `iooption_test.go`. The error message suggests that the value `generic.t1 (v164)` is incorrectly marked as live at the entry point. This issue leads to a stack trace involving multiple functions within the Go compiler, indicating a problem with the state management or SSA (Static Single Assignment) generation process.```

### What did you expect to see?

The same test runs fine with `go version go1.22.1 windows/amd64` and `go1.20.11`

I expect the test also to success for the latest gotip version.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""internal"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me break down the information provided.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions an internal compiler error related to a value being incorrectly live at entry. That sounds like something wrong in the compiler's handling, which is part of Go's internals.

The body describes that when running tests with gotip (the development version of Go), an internal compiler error occurs. The user provided their environment details and the stack trace from the crash. This indicates a problem within the Go compiler itself, not with the user's code or external libraries.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved the issue. They modified functions in the cmd/compile package, which is part of Go's internal compiler implementation. The changes involve adjusting how parentheses are handled during type checking, which is an internal detail of the compiler's operation.

Given all this, the label ""internal"" makes sense because the problem lies within the Go compiler's internals and was fixed by changing internal mechanisms. So yes, the label accurately reflects the issue.

The above is one example.

Currently, we keep the output columns unchanged when there's topn pushed down to tikv/tiflash.
But sometimes the order by expression may reduce the size of the column data transferred by the network significantly.
And another example is that the expression's evaluation cost is rather high. In that time we can also keep the expression, not to calculate it twice on tidb and tiflash/tikv.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""optimization"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The title of the issue isn't explicitly given, but from the context and the patches, it seems related to optimizing how TopN operations handle certain functions, specifically those involving vector distances. The body mentions that a label was assigned as ""optimization,"" so I need to see if the changes in the patches align with that.

Looking at Patch 7, there are significant modifications to how PhysicalTopN is handled. The code introduces a new optimization called HeavyFunctionOptimize. This optimization seems to prevent recalculating vector distances in TopN operations by adding an extra projection to store these distances. This means that instead of recalculating the distance for every row in each operation, it's calculated once and reused. That definitely sounds like an optimization because it reduces redundant calculations and should improve performance.

Patch 8 adds a new Fix56318 constant, which controls whether this HeavyFunctionOptimize is applied. The presence of such flags typically indicates that this is an intentional optimization to address a specific performance issue, allowing the change to be toggled if needed for compatibility or testing purposes.

The overall goal here seems to enhance efficiency by modifying how TopN handles certain expensive operations. By storing intermediate results (the distance calculations), the system avoids redundant work, which directly relates to optimizing resource usage and speeding up query execution.

Therefore, considering that the changes are aimed at improving performance through better handling of function calls within TopN operations, the label ""optimization"" fits perfectly.

microsoft/vscode,238725,enhancement,A developer command to show telemetry view,It is bit unreasonable to enable log level to trace to show the telemetry in the output. Instead there should be a developer command to show telemetry output and set log level to trace only for telemetry instead of all outputs,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""enhancement"" is accurate for this issue based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's in the question.

The user has given a series of patches made to various files in a repository. The patches are quite extensive and involve changes related to telemetry logging, specifically around how logs are handled, their visibility, and configuration. 

Looking at the title of the issue isn't provided here, but based on the patches, it seems like the focus is on improving or modifying how telemetry data is managed. For example, there are additions of new actions for showing telemetry, changes in how loggers are registered, and adjustments to environment services.

The label ""enhancement"" typically refers to issues that request new features or significant improvements to existing functionality. The patches here seem to add new methods for handling telemetry output visibility, introduce new action classes, and modify service configurations. These are not just bug fixes but rather additions that enhance the system's capabilities.

Considering that these changes are introducing new functionalities and improving how users can interact with telemetry data (like showing/hiding logs or setting log levels), it aligns well with the ""enhancement"" label. They're not fixing broken code but expanding what the code can do, which is a hallmark of an enhancement.

So, yes, the label accurately reflects the nature of the changes made.
</think>

The patches introduce new features and improvements to how telemetry logs are managed, such as adding actions to show telemetry data and enhancing log visibility. These are enhancements rather than bug fixes.

angular/angular,57983,server,`ServerModule` overrides `HttpClient` customizations,"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?

platform-server

### Is this a regression?

Yes

### Description

When using SSR with the module setup generated with `ng new --standalone=false --ssr=true` (or by `ng add @angular/ssr` to an existing module application), any `HttpClient` customizations are overridden by `ServerModule`. This is because `ServerModule` imports `HttpClientModule`. <URL>

The repro uses `angular-in-memory-web-api` to demo the customization behavior.

The following things fix this:
- Moving the `ServerModule` import above the `AppModule` in `AppServerModule` (<URL>
- Replacing the `ServerModule` import with `provideServerRendering()` (<URL>

### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug

### Please provide the exception or error you saw

_No response_

### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)

```The log shows details about the Angular environment setup, including the versions of Angular CLI, Node.js, npm, OS, and various Angular packages and dependencies installed.```


### Anything else?

IMO the *correct* fix is the replace `ServerModule` with `provideServerRendering()` in `@angular/ssr` scaffolding. `HttpClientModule` should probably not be imported by `ServerModule` either.

Related to <URL>",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine whether the label ""server"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""`ServerModule` overrides `HttpClient` customizations"". This immediately tells me that the issue is related to the ServerModule in Angular, which is part of the server-side rendering (SSR) functionality. The problem arises because ServerModule is overriding customizations made to HttpClient.

Next, I'll examine the body of the report. The user mentions using SSR with specific module setups and how ServerModule imports HttpClientModule, causing the override of customizations. They also provide links to repro steps and suggest moving ServerModule or replacing it with provideServerRendering(). Additionally, they link to another related issue, which further indicates that this is about server-related modules.

Now, looking at the patches provided: Patch 1 removes imports related to HttpClient and adjusts the NgModule declaration of ServerModule. Patch 2 also modifies ServerModule by removing the import of HttpClientModule and adjusting the imports in the module. These changes directly affect how ServerModule interacts with other parts of the application, specifically regarding HTTP client configurations.

The label ""server"" is assigned because the issue revolves around ServerModule and its impact on server-side rendering setups. Since both the problem description and the patches are focused on the ServerModule within Angular's SSR context, the label accurately captures the essence of the bug.

Therefore, the label ""server"" is appropriate for this issue.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39952,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Kafka 3.7.0,,1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Upgrade to Kafka 3.7.0"". This clearly indicates that the purpose of the issue is to update or upgrade Kafka from an older version to version 3.7.0. Upgrading a dependency like Kafka would fall under dependency management, which often involves updating versions in build configurations.

Next, the body of the issue is empty. Since there's no additional information provided beyond the title, I have to rely on the patches made to resolve the issue for more context.

Now, examining Patch 1: it shows a change from version 3.6.1 to 3.7.0 in a library dependency for Kafka. This directly points to an upgrade of the Kafka library used in the project. The patch is straightforward—changing the version number in what seems to be a build configuration file, possibly a Gradle or similar build script.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Given that the issue's title mentions an upgrade and the patch confirms changing the version number of Kafka, this aligns perfectly with what a dependency upgrade entails. Dependency upgrades typically involve updating libraries or frameworks to newer versions to take advantage of new features, bug fixes, or security patches.

I don't see any other labels mentioned here, but considering only ""dependency upgrade"", it seems appropriate because the entire issue revolves around updating Kafka's version. There are no indications that this is a bug fix, feature request, or anything else outside of dependency management.

So, putting it all together: title mentions an upgrade, patch shows version increase, and label is about upgrading dependencies. Everything matches up without any conflicting information.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the issue as both the title and patches indicate an update to Kafka's version.

golang/go,69086,alignment,cmd/cgo: alignment issue with int128 inside of a struct,"### Go version

go version go1.23.0 linux/amd64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```The log provides environment variables related to the Go programming language setup, including details such as the Go version (1.23.0), architecture (amd64), operating system (linux), and various paths and flags used by the Go toolchain.```


### What did you do?

From Go, I passed to C a struct containing one int128 (and another field before it so that Go needs to guess the padding between the first member and that int128 member).
From C, I wanted to read what I got from Go.

### go.mod
```The code snippet defines a module named `int128` and specifies Go version 1.23.0.```

### main.go
```This code snippet is written in Go and interacts with C code through cgo. It performs the following actions:

1. Defines a Go function `toC` that returns a `[16]byte` array.
2. Calls a C function `get_uint128`, prints its type and value.
3. Calls a C function `set_uint128` with a specific byte array, then prints the updated value of `get_uint128`.
4. Calls C functions to get and print details of a `struct_s128`, including its size, offsets, and values.
5. Calls C functions to set and get a new `struct_s128` with a specific byte array and length, then prints the updated structure.
6. Calls a C function `print_s128` with the updated `struct_s128`.```

### int128.h
```The code snippet defines a header file with function prototypes for setting and getting 128-bit unsigned integers (`unsigned __int128`), as well as a struct `s128` containing an integer, a 128-bit unsigned integer, and a byte length. It also includes functions to set and get instances of this struct, and to print such instances.```

### int128.c
```The code snippet defines structures and functions to handle 128-bit unsigned integers using `unsigned __int128`. It includes:

- Declaration of an `unsigned __int128` variable `x` initialized with a specific value.
- Definition of a structure `s128` containing a 128-bit number and a length field.
- Functions to:
  - Print details about a `s128` struct.
  - Set and get the value of `x`.
  - Set and get the value of `s`.

No optimizations or improvements are made; the code is left as-is.```

### What did you see happen?

The result is corrupted: C doesn't receive the correct int128.
This is because Go seems to not correctly guess the padding for int128 inside of a struct.

```The log shows multiple instances of structures and arrays being printed. Key points include:

- Two sequences of integers `[16 15 14... 1]` and `[1 2 3... 16]` are printed.
- A `struct_s128` with specific offsets and sizes is defined, containing an array of integers and other data.
- The `_Ctype___int128unsigned` type is used to print integer values.
- The `_Ctype_uchar` type is used to print the value `4` and `56`.
- An IP address-like sequence is printed at the end, formatted as `0.0.0.56.32.31.30.29.28.27.26.25.24.23.22.21/0`.```

Look how C and Go both have a different conception of that C struct:
- For C, the struct is 48 bytes long, and the int128 field is at offset 16.
- For Go, the struct is 44 bytes long, and the int128 field is at offset 12.

### What did you expect to see?

I expected Go to correctly guess the padding of the C struct, and to receive the correct int128 from C perspective.

C self-aligns the int128: i.e. it is aligned to a multiple of 16, which is its own size.

I would have expected to see this result:
```The log shows multiple instances of struct and type definitions, including `_Ctype___int128unsigned`, `main._Ctype_struct_s128`, and `main._Ctype_uchar`. It lists sequences of integers and a single byte value (42 and 56). The sequences of integers represent different ranges of indices, and the byte values are interspersed with these integer sequences. The final line summarizes a conversion process involving a sequence of integers and a byte value.```

Correct behavior can be obtained by making the C padding explicit and visible to Go:
```This code snippet defines a struct `s128` that contains an integer `x`, an array of 12 padding bytes `_pad`, a 128-bit unsigned integer `num`, and a single byte `len`.```",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""alignment"" is accurate for this issue report based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""cmd/compile: incorrect alignment of __int128 fields in structs"". This immediately suggests that there's a problem with how the compiler is handling the alignment of a specific type (__int128) within structures. So alignment seems to be a key aspect here.

Next, reading through the body of the issue, the user explains that when they tried to use a C struct containing an int, __int128, and unsigned char, Go's understanding of the struct layout didn't match what C expects. Specifically, Go thought the struct was 44 bytes with certain offsets, while C saw it as 48 bytes with different offsets. The problem arises because the __int128 type requires a specific alignment (16 bytes), but Go wasn't accounting for that correctly.

The user provided patches to fix this issue. Looking at Patch 1 and Patch 2, they modify how types are loaded and structures are padded in the compiler. For instance, in Patch 1, there's an adjustment where if the type's alignment is greater than or equal to the pointer size (which __int128 likely is), it sets the alignment to match the pointer size. This seems like a fix to ensure that __int128 fields get the proper alignment.

Patch 3 adds test cases related to issue 69086, which involves structs with __int128 and checks their alignment and offset in both C and Go. The tests are verifying that after the fix, the alignment is correct, and the struct layout matches between Go and C.

So, all these patches are addressing how the compiler calculates the size and alignment of types within structures, particularly focusing on ensuring proper alignment for __int128 fields to match C's expectations.

The label assigned was ""alignment"". Considering that the problem revolves around incorrect alignment leading to mismatched struct layouts between Go and C, and the fixes specifically target the calculation and setting of correct alignments, this label seems spot on. The core issue is indeed about alignment problems in structs containing __int128 fields.

Therefore, I conclude that the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

The label ""alignment"" correctly captures the essence of the problem, which revolves around incorrect struct alignment due to __int128 fields.

go-gitea/gitea,32427,database,Deleting a tag for a release breaks the release,"### Description

The web UI does not allow deleting tags that are associated with an existing release. However, it can be done via the git client. Doing so turns the release into a draft release. Pushing the tag again does not fix the release.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a repository with some content and clone it locally
2. Add a tag: `git tag test`
3. Push the tag: `git push origin test`
4. Create a release for the tag
5. Delete the tag on the server: `git push origin --delete test`
6. Observe that the release is now a ""draft""
7. Push the tag again: `git push origin test`
8. Observer that the release is still a ""draft""

### Observations

When pushing the tag a second time, the following message is logged:
```The log indicates that an error occurred while trying to push updates to the repository `example-repo`. Specifically, there was an issue with inserting tags due to a duplicate key value violating a unique constraint named ""UQE_release_n"".```
I can't provide more detailed logs at the moment. I can set up a test environment, though, if necessary.

This is a regression. We upgraded from 1.21.x, which did not show this behaviour. Unfortunately, I did not make note which exact version we used before.

### Use case

I realise deleting are re-creating tags from the command line seems like an odd thing to do. We do it as part of a nightly build pipe line, which builds binaries and attaches them to a moving tag and release named `latest`.

### Database

PostgreSQL",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""database"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""Deleting a tag for a release breaks the release."" This suggests that when a tag is deleted, it affects the associated release in an unintended way, specifically turning it into a draft. 

The body explains that deleting a tag via git client causes the release to become a draft, and pushing the tag again doesn't fix it. The steps to reproduce involve creating a tag, pushing it, making a release, then deleting and re-pushing the tag, which results in the release being a draft. The error log mentions a duplicate key violation in the database when trying to push the tag again. This indicates a problem with how the database handles releases and tags.

The patches provided are two: Patch 1 modifies the `pushUpdateAddTags` function, changing the way releases are fetched (including drafts) and updating release properties. It adjusts whether a release is a draft or not based on whether it's a tag. Patch 2 adds a test case that simulates the scenario of creating, deleting, and re-adding a tag to ensure the release doesn't remain a draft after the tag is pushed again.

The key point here is the database interaction. The error log points to a unique constraint violation when trying to add a tag again, suggesting that the database isn't handling the deletion and re-addition correctly. The patches modify how releases are fetched and updated in the database, particularly around draft status and ensuring that re-adding the tag correctly updates the release.

Therefore, the issue is directly related to how the database manages releases and their associated tags, making the ""database"" label appropriate.
</think>

The issue revolves around database constraints and how releases and tags are managed within the database. The patches address these by modifying database queries and update logic, ensuring proper handling of draft statuses when tags are deleted and recreated.

php/php-src,15331,bug,dom: Element::$substitutedNodeValue test failed,"### Description

Trying to package PHP 8.4 for testing on NixOS, when building the `dom` extension, I get the following failed test:

```The code snippet refers to a test file named `Element_substitutedNodeValue.phpt` located in the `tests/modern/extensions/` directory, which appears to be part of a PHP testing suite. The file likely contains tests related to the `substitutedNodeValue` method or property of the `Element` class.```

Looks like the tests is newly added in <URL>

### `ext/dom/tests/modern/extensions/Element_substitutedNodeValue.out`

```The code snippet outputs strings and XML fragments with varying content and null values. Specifically, it generates:

1. `""1""` followed by `NULL` and then an XML fragment `<root>1</root>`.
2. `""<> ""` followed by `NULL` and then an XML fragment `<root>&lt;&gt;</root>`.
3. `""""` (an empty string) followed by `NULL` and then an XML fragment `<root/>`.```

### `ext/dom/tests/modern/extensions/Element_substitutedNodeValue.diff`

```The log shows three different outputs:
1. An empty string.
2. The `NULL` value.
3. An XML snippet with a root element that is empty but self-closing (`<root/>`). The log also includes line numbers (012-) and (012+) to indicate a potential change from an initially empty `<root>` tag to a self-closing one.```

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that resolved it.

First, let's look at the issue itself. The title is ""dom: Element::$substitutedNodeValue test failed."" That sounds like a problem with a specific test case failing in the DOM extension of PHP. 

In the body, the user describes trying to package PHP 8.4 and encountering a failed test when building the 'dom' extension. They provided details about the test that's failing, including output and diffs. It seems like this is an issue where a new test introduced in PR #14754 is causing a failure.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved the issue:

Patch 1 mentions fixing bug GH-15331 related to Element::$substitutedNodeValue test failure. So the patch directly addresses a problem with the test, indicating it's a bug fix.

Patch 2 modifies the expected output of the test by changing from a specific string expectation to using an EXPECTF pattern that allows either form of XML closing tags (like </root> or <root/>). This suggests that the original test was too strict and didn't account for different valid XML formats, causing it to fail incorrectly.

Putting this together: The issue is about a failed test which turned out to be due to an incorrect expectation in the test itself. The fix adjusts the test to accept multiple valid outputs, thus resolving the failure. Since the problem was with the test case expecting a specific output that wasn't necessarily correct, it's accurately labeled as a bug because it represents an unexpected behavior or flaw in the code (in this case, the test).

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""bug"" is appropriate.
</think>

The label ""bug"" correctly identifies the issue as it pertains to a failed test caused by incorrect expectations. The patches address this by fixing the test's expected outputs.

spring-projects/spring-framework,34051,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Reactor 2024.0.1,,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break down what each part tells me.

First, the title of the issue is ""Upgrade to Reactor 2024.0.1"". That clearly indicates that the purpose is to update a dependency related to Reactor to a specific version. So the main goal here seems to be about upgrading a library or tool.

Looking at the body of the issue, it's empty. There's no additional information provided beyond the title. So I don't have any extra context there, but the title itself is pretty straightforward.

Now, checking the patches that resolved this issue: There's only one patch shown here. It modifies a line in what looks like a build.gradle file or similar, changing the version of ""reactor-bom"" from a SNAPSHOT version (2024.0.1-SNAPSHOT) to a release version (2024.0.1). This change is within the dependencies block, specifically under api(platform(...)), which suggests it's managing dependency versions for the project.

So putting this together: The issue title mentions an upgrade, and the patch confirms that by updating the Reactor BOM from a SNAPSHOT to a stable release version. Therefore, the action taken was indeed a dependency upgrade.

The label ""dependency upgrade"" is assigned here. Since both the title and the patch directly relate to updating a dependency's version, this label accurately reflects the issue.

— [watchflakes](<URL>
",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""net/http/pprof: TestHandlers//debug/pprof/trace failures"". It mentions a test failure related to pprof in the net/http package. So, it's about a failing test case.

Next, the body of the issue includes a watchflakes directive and an example log. The log shows that when running TestHandlers//debug/pprof/trace, there's a WARNING: DATA RACE. Data races are a type of concurrency bug where multiple goroutines access shared data without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior.

The stack trace points to several functions, including runtime.closechan(), runtime.(*wakeableSleep).close(), and net/http/pprof.Trace(). The error message clearly states ""race detected during execution of test"", which means the test is failing because of a race condition. So the issue is about a race condition causing a test failure.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue. The code changes are in the wakeableSleep struct methods: sleep(), wake(), and close(). They added calls to raceacquire and racerelease around the lock operations when raceenabled is true. These functions are part of Go's race detector, helping to detect data races by properly tracking lock acquisitions and releases.

So the patches are adding proper synchronization checks to prevent the data race detected in the test. This indicates that the root cause was a race condition due to incorrect or missing synchronization when accessing shared resources.

The label assigned is ""runtime error"". But wait, what's a runtime error? Typically, that refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, like division by zero or null pointer exceptions. However, in this case, it's a data race detected by the test, not an actual crash or exception at runtime.

The issue is more accurately described as a concurrency bug or a race condition. Since the problem was causing test failures due to races, labeling it as ""runtime error"" might be misleading because it doesn't indicate a crash but rather a test failure from a data race.

So, considering all this, does ""runtime error"" fit? I think it's not precise. The issue is about a race condition leading to test failure, not an actual runtime error in the application itself beyond the test suite.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""shutdown"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue report. Let's start by reading through the problem thoroughly.

The issue title is ""x/tools/gopls: mod cache refresh timers run after view shutdown"". The body describes a test failure where a goroutine profile shows an error when trying to clean up the sandbox, specifically mentioning that a directory isn't empty. This happens during the shutdown phase of a test.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a `stop()` method to `refreshTimer`, which stops any scheduled refresh and releases resources. It also modifies the `schedule()` function to handle cases where the timer might be stopped, ensuring the refresh function isn't called after stopping.

Patch 2 adds a call to `v.importsState.stopTimer()` in the `shutdown()` method of the View struct. This means that during shutdown, any ongoing mod cache refresh timers are explicitly stopped.

The label assigned is ""shutdown"". The issue revolves around timers continuing to run after the view has shut down, causing cleanup issues. The patches address this by stopping these timers during shutdown. Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem and its solution.

So yes, the label is appropriate.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40321,bug,@ServletComponentScan does not register servlet components in a mock web environment,Forward port of issue #39736 to 3.2.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.

The issue's title says ""@ServletComponentScan does not register servlet components in a mock web environment."" That sounds like something isn't working as expected. The body mentions it's a forward port of another issue, which suggests that the problem was already identified and is being addressed again for a different version or context.

Looking at the patches provided, there are two main changes. Patch 1 modifies some code in a class called ServletComponentRegisteringPostProcessor. It adds an import for MockServletContext and another for ClassUtils. Then it introduces a new static boolean checking if MockServletContext is present. The method isRunningInEmbeddedWebServer() is renamed to eligibleForServletComponentScanning(), and the condition inside this method changes. Now, it not only checks if the servlet context is null but also considers whether the context is an instance of MockServletContext when MOCK_SERVLET_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE is true.

Patch 2 adds a new test class called MockWebEnvironmentServletComponentScanIntegrationTests. This class has several test methods that check if components are registered correctly in a mock environment, including tests for registration, indexed components, and multipart configurations. The presence of these tests indicates that the original code didn't handle the mock setup properly before.

Putting this together, the issue was that @ServletComponentScan wasn't registering components when used in a mock web environment, which is likely a testing scenario. This caused some components not to be detected or registered as expected. The patches fix this by adjusting how the application determines whether it's eligible for scanning and adding comprehensive tests to ensure it works in mock setups.

Since this problem was causing functionality to fail under certain conditions (specifically in a mock environment), it fits the definition of a bug. Bugs are issues where the code doesn't behave as intended, leading to incorrect or unexpected results. The fact that they added tests also supports that this was a bug because they wanted to prevent regressions.

Therefore, the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue.
</think>

The label ""bug"" is appropriate here because the issue describes a malfunction in how servlet components are registered in a mock environment, which was fixed with code changes and tests.

golang/go,65573,module,cmd/go: separate default GODEBUGs from go language version,"Go 1.21 introduced a formalization of how we handle compatible-but-breaking changes, defining configuration knobs called GODEBUG settings that let users control whether or when these changes happen in their specific programs. The current docs are <<URL> and the proposal was #56986. The default settings are taken from the “go” version line in the go.mod file for the main package, and main package Go source files can override with `//go:debug key=value` lines.

Go 1.21 also introduced additional forward compatibility rules, among them that the “go” line in any module must be the max of all the “go” lines in its dependencies. Among other things, this means that when deciding whether the current toolchain is new enough to build a module at all, only the top-level “go” line needs to be consulted. This is documented at <<URL> and the proposal was #57001.

These two interact in an unfortunate way: a maintenance version M of a particular program wants to lock in the GODEBUG semantics from the release they started with, which they can do by setting the “go” line even as they update to newer toolchains. But when they update to newer versions of dependencies, if those dependencies have updated to newer “go” lines, that will force using a newer “go” line in the top-level module, which changes the default GODEBUG settings. If this happens for one dependency, it can be forked and replaced. For a module with a large dependency tree, it may well happen with many dependencies, at which point fork+replace does not scale.

Another possible workaround is to add //go:debug lines to every package main in the module. This is reasonable _except_ that there is no way to predict which ones to add. The point is to say “be like Go 1.X” for some X, but when the module updates to a “go 1.(X+1)” line, the GODEBUG settings from Go 1.(X+1) become relevant, and those can't be predicted when cutting the maintenance branch.

I propose two changes to allow separation of the default GODEBUGs from the “go” line in the go.mod.

First, add a new meta-setting “default=go1.X” that means “set everything the way Go 1.X was”, the same as the “go 1.X” line means. This would let you have a module that says “go 1.23” but a main program that says `//go:debug default=go1.21`. In terms of this new meta-setting, the “go 1.X” line in go.mod essentially implies `//go:debug default=go1.X` in each main package. The meta-setting can be used in $GODEBUG as well, of course.

Second, add a new “godebug” line to go.mod, respected only in the current module (like toolchain, replace, and exclude are only respected in the current module), as well as to go.work (again like those). It takes a single k=v argument, same as a `//go:debug` source line, but it applies to all the package main in the module. So you can write

	go 1.23
	godebug default=go1.21

Setting multiple GODEBUGs is done with multiple debug lines (just as it is done with multiple `//go:debug` source lines), and like everything else in the go.mod or go.work file, godebug lines can be factored:

	go 1.23

	godebug (
		default=go1.21
		panicnil=0
	)

The precedence order would be: run-time $GODEBUG wins, then //go:debug lines in package main, then go.work or go.mod (go.work when using a workspace, go.mod otherwise).

If this proposal is accepted for Go 1.23, we may want to consider whether to backport either just the first step or both steps to Go 1.22 and possibly Go 1.21. Go 1.22 in particular has [a _lot_ of new GODEBUG settings](<URL> That's good: we are paying close attention to compatibility. But it's also a bit difficult to cope with in modules that need a “go 1.22” line due to updated dependencies but also want Go 1.21 semantics from their GODEBUG settings. Being able to write `//go:debug default=go1.21` could be worth backporting there. Go 1.21 has fewer relevant settings: basically just panicnil. But our typical rule is that if a fix is deemed critical to backport, we backport it to all supported releases. 

Note that backporting the godebug directive in go.mod does not cause any compatibility concerns for older go commands seeing these in dependencies: unknown directives are always ignored in dependency go.mods, for precisely this reason.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine whether the label ""module"" accurately reflects the issue report described in the provided context. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it's about adding support for a new feature called `//go:debug`. This directive is meant to set debugging options, similar to the GODEBUG environment variable but at build time. The patches include modifications to both `go.mod` and `go.work` files, which are central to Go modules.

Next, examining the body of the issue, it describes how the feature should behave in different contexts—whether it's defined in go.mod or go.work, and how they interact with each other and the build process. This ties directly into module configuration and build settings, which are key aspects of Go's module system.

Looking at the patches provided:

1. **Patch 4**: Adds functions to handle `godebug` directives in `go.mod`, including parsing and validation. It checks for valid keys and ensures that certain values meet specific criteria (like versioning for the ""default"" key). This is clearly related to module configuration.

2. **Patch 5**: Modifies the `go work edit` command to support adding or removing `godebug` entries in `go.work`. This shows integration with workspace configuration, which is an extension of modules.

3. **Patches 7-9**: These introduce test cases and examples that demonstrate how the new directives are used within module files (`go.mod` and `go.work`). They also show error handling for invalid directives, ensuring that only correctly formatted options are allowed.

The feature itself extends Go's build and module system by adding a way to set debugging options directly in module configuration files. This affects both individual modules and workspaces (which manage multiple modules), making it a module-related issue.

Furthermore, the tests and examples provided focus on how these directives integrate with existing module commands like `go mod edit` and `go work edit`, reinforcing that this is about enhancing module functionality.

Therefore, considering all these points, the label ""module"" accurately reflects the nature of the changes. The feature is about adding new debugging directives within Go modules and workspaces, which are core aspects of the module system.
</think>

The issue report is about adding a new `//go:debug` directive to set GODEBUG options in Go source files, specifically within the context of Go modules (`go.mod`) and workspaces (`go.work`). The patches modify how these module-related files handle debugging configurations. Since the changes are directly tied to module configuration and build settings, the label ""module"" is appropriate.

spring-projects/spring-boot,42115,dependency upgrade,Bump gradle/actions from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1,Forward port of issue #42090 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and patches.

First, looking at the title: ""Bump gradle/actions from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1"". The word ""bump"" here suggests an increment or update in version, typically a minor one, which is characteristic of a dependency upgrade. So the title points towards a version increase.

Next, the body states: ""Forward port of issue #42090 to 3.3.x."" This indicates that the fix or change from another issue is being applied to a different branch, specifically the 3.3.x line. Forward-porting often involves applying similar changes, which in this context might be about updating dependencies to maintain consistency across branches.

Now examining the patches:

Patch 1 updates the setup-gradle action from version 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 by changing the commit hash. This is a clear indication of a dependency upgrade, specifically a minor version bump within the same major and minor release.

Patch 2 modifies two steps: one for wrapper-validation and another for setup-gradle, both updating from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1. Again, this shows that dependencies are being upgraded to a newer version in the same series.

Patch 3 also updates the setup-gradle action from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1, consistent with the previous patches. This further supports that the change is about upgrading dependencies.

All three patches consistently show that the gradle/actions components are being updated from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 across different jobs in the workflow. There's no indication of a major version change or any other type of modification beyond a version upgrade.

Considering all these points, the label ""dependency upgrade"" fits well because the issue is about updating dependencies to a newer minor version without introducing breaking changes or major reworks.
</think>

The patches consistently update gradle/actions from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 across multiple workflow steps, indicating a dependency upgrade.

`````The code imports `Features` and `transform` from `lightningcss@1.24.1`, then uses `transform` to process CSS with modules enabled, nesting included, and a simple CSS rule provided as input.```
With deno 1.44.1 and before, it works fine. but with 1.44.2, it throws an error
```The code snippet shows an uncaught error in a promise, followed by a `console.log` statement that attempts to log the result of the `transform` function, which is throwing an error.```

lightningcss is a native library written in rust, so I guess the problem is related to node api.",1,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""regression"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Some node api may be broken in 1.44.2 ?"". That immediately suggests that something was working before but stopped working after an update to version 1.44.2. That sounds like a regression because regressions typically refer to bugs or issues that were introduced in a newer version, breaking functionality that previously worked.

Now, the body of the issue provides more context. The user shared some code using lightningcss, which worked fine with Deno 1.44.1 and earlier versions but started throwing an error after upgrading to 1.44.2. This is a clear indication of a regression because it points out that an update caused previously working code to fail.

The patches provided are four in total. Let's go through them briefly:

Patch 1: It modifies functions related to creating external strings in Latin1 and UTF16 encoding. The changes involve correctly setting the status, handling finalize callbacks, and properly indicating if data was copied. This suggests that there might have been issues with string handling in Node.js APIs, which could cause errors when using certain libraries.

Patch 2: This patch adjusts how buffer information is retrieved. It removes some checks related to buffer constructors and adds a comment about TypedArray instances being accepted. This change likely fixes an issue where buffers weren't correctly recognized after the update.

Patch 3: Here, there's an addition of URL handling for file paths when creating EnvShared. The error handling for invalid paths is improved, which could prevent crashes or errors related to how file paths are processed.

Patch 4: This seems to be about setting default configurations in the Process.config object. It specifies that the default configuration should be ""Release"". This might affect how dependencies or modules are compiled or loaded, potentially resolving issues with library compatibility.

Putting it all together, these patches address specific areas where the update to Deno 1.44.2 introduced problems. The changes fix Node.js API functionalities that were broken, which aligns perfectly with the user's report of a regression.

So, considering all this, the label ""regression"" is spot on because the issue arose after an update and was resolved by fixing newly introduced bugs.
</think>

The label ""regression"" accurately reflects the issue as it describes a bug introduced in a newer version that broke previously functioning code. The patches address these regressions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the label ""plugin"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches that resolved it.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""Zip archive explorer plugin incorrectly handles files with spaces in their names."" The word ""plugin"" is right there, which suggests that this is about a specific Vim plugin, probably the zip archive explorer. So that already points towards the label being correct.

Next, the body of the issue describes steps to reproduce the problem using gVim with an archive file. It mentions that when trying to open a file with spaces in its name from within the zip archive, it doesn't display correctly. The expected behavior is that the contents should show up, but instead, a blank window appears. This clearly indicates an issue with how the plugin handles such files.

Now, looking at the patches provided. They modify several lines in what seems to be a Vim script file related to handling zip archives. The key changes involve how filenames are escaped and handled, especially on Windows systems. For example, there's a change in the way the `s:Escape` function works, specifically adding a check for shellslash on Windows to correctly handle backslashes. This indicates that the problem was within the plugin's code, particularly in functions responsible for reading and escaping filenames.

The patches also include comments like ""handle whitespace on Windows properly,"" which directly ties into the issue described—incorrect handling of filenames with spaces. Additionally, the function `zip#Read` is modified to correctly escape filenames, ensuring that spaces are handled without causing issues when invoking external commands like unzip.

Putting it all together: The problem was specific to a plugin (the zip archive explorer), and the solution involved modifying the plugin's code to handle filenames with spaces properly. Therefore, assigning the label ""plugin"" accurately captures the nature of this issue because it pertains directly to the functionality and code of that particular Vim plugin.

Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""bug"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. I'm new to evaluating these things, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I look at the title of the issue: ""`MapAccessor#canWrite` incorrectly returns `true` for non-`Map` target"". It mentions that a method called canWrite in MapAccessor is returning true when it shouldn't. So this sounds like something isn't working as expected, which might be a bug.

Next, the body says it's a follow-up to another issue (#33222) and specifies that `canWrite` should only return true if the target is an instance of `java.util.Map`. That makes sense because if canWrite returns true for non-Map objects, it could cause unexpected behavior elsewhere in the code.

Now looking at the patches. The first patch changes the canWrite method from returning `this.allowWrite` to `(this.allowWrite && target instanceof Map)`. So they're adding a check to ensure that the target is actually a Map before allowing write access. That definitely seems like fixing incorrect behavior, which aligns with a bug fix.

The second patch adds tests for this functionality. They test cases where the target is an Object (which should return false), a regular Map (should be true if allowWrite is true), and an immutable Map (also returns true). Then they test when allowWrite is false, ensuring it returns false in those cases. Adding these tests confirms that the behavior was incorrect before and now works as intended after the fix.

Putting this together: The issue describes a method not behaving correctly, and the patches both adjust the code to correct that behavior and add tests to verify the fix. This fits well under the label ""bug"" because it's about fixing an unintended behavior in the system.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves correcting incorrect method behavior through code changes and test additions.

",0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""type system"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Bad suggestion for refutable let without equals."" The key terms here are ""refutable let"" and ""suggestion."" Refutable patterns in Rust are about how variables are bound, specifically when a pattern might not match all possible cases. So this seems related to how the language handles variable bindings and their patterns.

The body of the issue includes some Rust code that's causing an error. The user declares `let Some(x);` and then assigns `x = 1;`. The error message points out that this is a refutable pattern in a local binding, which isn't allowed because `let` requires an irrefutable pattern. The compiler suggests using `let else`, but the user argues that this isn't applicable here because `let else` can't be used with deferred initialization.

Looking at the patches provided, they seem to modify parts of the Rust compiler. Specifically, the first patch adds a condition to check if the scrutinee is some type before offering the suggestion. The subsequent patches remove certain help messages related to using `if let` in various macro contexts. This indicates that the issue is about the compiler's error messages and when it should or shouldn't suggest certain workarounds.

The main problem here is that the compiler was incorrectly suggesting a solution (`let else`) that doesn't fit all scenarios, especially when initialization is deferred. The patches fix this by ensuring that such suggestions are only made when appropriate.

Now, considering the label assigned: ""type system."" The type system in Rust deals with how types are defined, their relationships, and ensuring type safety. However, this issue isn't directly about a type error or type checking. Instead, it's more about the compiler's handling of patterns in variable bindings and the accuracy of its error messages.

So, while the problem relates to language semantics, which includes type systems, the specific issue is more accurately categorized under ""compiler errors"" or ""error handling,"" as it deals with how the compiler presents solutions to certain syntax or pattern-related issues. The patches are modifying the error reporting mechanism rather than the type system itself.

Therefore, labeling this issue as ""type system"" might be a bit misleading because the core of the problem isn't about types but about the compiler's suggestions for refutable patterns.
</think>

The label assigned is not accurate because the issue pertains to error messages and pattern handling, not the type system directly.

pytorch/pytorch,141187,runtime error,[User Empathy Day] Watermark-Anything AOTAutograd crash,"Getting an internal assert failure:
```The log indicates a runtime error encountered during the execution of a PyTorch operation, specifically within the `aten._upsample_bilinear2d_aa_backward.default` function. The error is an `RuntimeError` with the message ""isIntList() INTERNAL ASSERT FAILED"" and suggests that the expected data type (`IntList`) was not matched with the actual data type (`GenericList`). This failure occurred while attempting to run the meta operation for an upsample bilinear backward pass.

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" is accurate for this issue report.

First, looking at the problem description: The user encountered a crash in their code when using certain transformations from the transforms module, specifically Resize with antialias set to True. They provided an error log showing that it's related to a backend compiler failure with 'inductor' as the backend. The error message mentions an internal assertion failure in PyTorch, saying ""Expected IntList but got GenericList"". 

The patches they applied are in several parts:
1. Removing xfail annotations for specific tests.
2. Adding new test cases that seem to handle dynamic shapes and ensure backward passes work correctly with upsample operations.
3. Registering a meta function for the _upsample_bilinear2d_aa_backward operation, which includes checks on the dimensions of the grad_output tensor.
4. Modifying sample inputs alias copy by removing an xfail decorator.

The issue revolves around a runtime error occurring during the execution of code that uses PyTorch's interpolate or upsample functions with antialias enabled. The error arises from an internal check in PyTorch expecting an IntList but receiving a GenericList instead, which points to a type mismatch somewhere in how these operations are handled.

The patches suggest that the problem was due to incorrect handling of dynamic shapes during backward passes, especially in cases where symbolic tensors were involved. By adding proper shape checks and ensuring that the grad_output matches expected dimensions, they prevented the runtime error from occurring.

So, does ""runtime error"" accurately label this issue? Yes, because it's about an error that occurs during execution (not compile time) when certain operations are performed with specific parameters. The patches address how PyTorch handles these operations to prevent the crash at runtime.

4. Check setting and `terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning` is setted false.[note2](<URL>

",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""configuration"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what each part of the issue says.

The title mentions that `terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning` is set to false. So right away, it seems like the problem is related to a specific configuration setting in VS Code.

Looking at the body, the user describes steps where they didn't set the option initially but after pasting multiple lines and checking the ""Do not ask me again"" box, the setting gets set to false. This indicates that the issue revolves around how this particular configuration is being handled when certain actions are taken in the terminal.

Now, examining the patch provided: it shows a change where instead of setting the value to `false`, it's being set to `'never'`. This directly pertains to how the configuration for multi-line paste warnings is updated. The developer changed the way the configuration service updates this specific setting.

The label ""configuration"" seems fitting because the issue and its resolution both involve changing a configuration option in VS Code. There’s no mention of bugs, new features, or other categories that might require different labels like ""bug"" or ""feature-request."" The problem is specifically about how a configuration value is being set after certain user actions.

I don't see any aspects here that would suggest another label is more appropriate. It's all centered around the handling and updating of a specific setting within the application, which aligns well with the ""configuration"" label.

I'm fixing it.",0,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Bootstraps nix patching broke after LLVM 18"". This suggests that an issue arose after upgrading LLVM to version 18, which affected the bootstrapping process related to Nix patching.

The body of the issue explains that the problem was caused by changes in libllvm's name and the linker script introduced in LLVM 18. The error message indicates a failure when trying to run rustc, with a shared library (libz.so.1) missing. The user mentions they're fixing it, which implies some code changes were made.

Now, examining the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies how libraries are processed. Instead of checking for "".so"" extensions, it now checks if the filename contains "".so"" and verifies if it's an ELF file before applying fixes. This suggests that the issue was due to the way shared libraries were being handled after the LLVM upgrade.

Patch 2 introduces a helper function `path_is_dylib` which checks if a path contains "".so"", replacing previous extension checks. This indicates a change in how shared libraries are detected, likely adapting to the new naming conventions from LLVM 18.

Both patches seem to adjust how the system identifies and processes shared libraries, accommodating changes brought by the LLVM upgrade. The problem wasn't just about upgrading a dependency but specifically about handling changes in library names and structures after an upgrade.

The label ""dependency upgrade"" is somewhat relevant because the issue occurred after an upgrade (LLVM 18). However, it doesn't capture the essence of the problem, which was about adapting to specific changes in how libraries are named and linked. The patches address these adaptation issues rather than just upgrading a dependency.

Therefore, while related, ""dependency upgrade"" might not fully encapsulate the nature of the issue. A more precise label could be something like ""compatibility fix"" or ""post-upgrade patching"", but since those aren't options, I have to decide if ""dependency upgrade"" is accurate enough.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" doesn't fully capture the specific issue of adapting to library changes post-upgrade. The patches address compatibility rather than just an upgrade.

angular/angular,56767,change detection,`eventCoalescing` breaks things in a `fakeAsync` test,"### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?

core

### Is this a regression?

No

### Description

When using `eventCoalescing: true` in combination with `fakeAsync`, any event triggered will then block `NgZone.onMicrotaskEmpty` and `.onStable` for the rest of the test. Coalescing schedules change detection to be run in a way that the fake async zone cannot see, I think because of the `Zone.root.run()` used [here](<URL> This causes the `NgZone` to be marked as having a microtask pending [here](<URL> which never gets cleared. So as long as the zone thinks a microtask is pending it will never emit `onMicrotaskEmpty` nor `onStable` (see the check [here](<URL>

Users do not need to use `onMicrotaskEmpty` or `onStable` directly to be affected. I noticed this when using an `afterRender` hook, which is internally triggered by `onMicrotaskEmpty`. Here is a repro showing that situation:

```````This code snippet sets up a test case using Angular's testing utilities to verify coalesced change detection. It defines two components: `InnerComponent` and `OuterComponent`. The `InnerComponent` includes an `afterRender` hook that sets a flag when the component is rendered. The `OuterComponent` conditionally renders the `InnerComponent` based on a boolean property. The test triggers a click event, changes the boolean property, and uses `tick()` to simulate asynchronous tasks, expecting the `afterRender` hook to be triggered.```

### Anything else?

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""change detection"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

First, the title of the issue is '`eventCoalescing` breaks things in a `fakeAsync` test'. This immediately tells me that the problem is related to event coalescing causing issues within fake async tests. Event coalescing is a feature that groups events to optimize performance, which ties into how Angular handles change detection and rendering.

Looking at the body of the issue, the user explains that using `eventCoalescing: true` with `fakeAsync` causes `NgZone.onMicrotaskEmpty` and `.onStable` to be blocked. They mention that this is because the change detection is scheduled in a way that the fake async zone can't detect it, specifically pointing to the use of `Zone.root.run()` in ng_zone.ts. This leads to microtasks not being cleared properly, which affects hooks like `afterRender`. The provided test case shows how using these configurations results in the `ranAfterRenderHook` not being triggered as expected.

The patches made involve changing a constant from `true` to `false`, specifically `SCHEDULE_IN_ROOT_ZONE_DEFAULT`. This constant likely controls whether change detection is scheduled in the root zone or not. By setting it to false, the scheduling behavior changes, which probably resolves the issue by ensuring that the fake async zone can properly track microtasks and emit the necessary events.

Now, considering the label assigned: ""change detection"". The core of this issue revolves around how Angular schedules change detection runs, especially in relation to zones (like `fakeAsync`) and event coalescing. The problem affects when and how change detection is triggered, which directly impacts the hooks and stability checks (`onMicrotaskEmpty`, `onStable`). Therefore, the label ""change detection"" accurately captures the essence of the bug because it's about the mechanism that detects and applies changes in the application.

I don't see any other labels mentioned, but since this issue is specifically about how change detection scheduling interacts with zones and event coalescing, the assigned label seems appropriate. There might be other related areas like ""testing"" or ""zone.js"", but based on the provided information, ""change detection"" is the most accurate.

Alright, let's break down whether the label ""status bar"" accurately reflects the given issue report.

First, looking at the title: ""Voice Keyword Activation appeared in status bar with latest Insiders update."" This clearly mentions the status bar, indicating that something unexpected showed up there.

The body of the issue describes the user seeing a microphone icon in the status bar with a confusing tooltip. They also mention clicking on it leading to settings, which adds to their confusion. The user didn't expect to see this until they explicitly allowed mic usage. So, the problem revolves around an unintended status bar item appearing.

Now, examining the patches provided. The first patch introduces a function `supportsKeywordActivation` that checks if voice activation is supported based on configuration and speech services. This function is then used in `handleKeywordActivation` to determine if keyword activation should be enabled. 

Another part of the patch modifies the `updateStatusEntry` method, changing the visibility condition from checking a configuration value directly to using the new `supportsKeywordActivation` function. This means that the status bar entry's visibility is now correctly tied to whether voice activation is actually supported and enabled.

The changes ensure that the status bar item (the microphone icon) only appears when it's supposed to, based on the user's settings and available speech services. So, the patches directly address the issue of an unexpected status bar item showing up.

Considering all this, the label ""status bar"" is indeed appropriate because the problem and its solution both pertain to the visibility and behavior of a status bar element.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it pertains to an unexpected status bar item.

### Expected Output

`````The log indicates that an `HttpProxyMissingHost` error occurred because the `https_proxy` environment variable is empty.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""environment"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""http: unhelpful error 'message' when `https_proxy` env variable is empty"". It mentions an environment variable, specifically `https_proxy`, so that's a clue that the issue relates to environment variables.

The body of the issue describes how setting up proxies with Zig didn't give a helpful error message. The user had various proxy variables set but empty. They mention that it took them time to figure out because the error wasn't clear, and they suggest that Zig should guide users better in such cases. So again, the problem is about environment variables causing an issue.

Now looking at the patches. There are changes in a function called `createProxyFromEnvVar`. The patch adds a check for empty content from environment variables. Before, it just continued if the variable wasn't found, but now it also skips if the content is zero length. This means that the fix is about correctly handling cases where an environment variable exists but is empty.

So putting it all together: the issue is specifically about how environment variables are handled in error messages and proxy setup. The label ""environment"" seems to fit because it's directly related to environment variables causing unexpected behavior or errors. Even though the patches also involve error messaging, the root cause is the handling of these variables.

I don't see any other aspects like performance or security here; it's purely about how the system interacts with environment variables. So yes, ""environment"" accurately reflects this issue.
</think>

The label ""environment"" correctly captures that the issue revolves around environment variables affecting the application's behavior and error messaging. The problem was due to empty proxy variables, and the fix addressed handling such cases.

Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""extension"" correctly reflects the GitHub issue report provided. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Segmentation fault in ext/opcache/jit/ir/ir_cfg.c"". The path suggests it's related to the OPcache extension, which is part of PHP's extensions. So that aligns with the label ""extension"".

Next, the body describes a bug where running a specific PHP script causes a segmentation fault. The stack trace points to AddressSanitizer errors in files under ext/opcache/jit/, reinforcing that it's an issue within the OPcache extension.

The patches provided are modifying code in ir_cfg.c and other files within the same directory. These changes are specifically fixing how the Intermediate Representation (IR) control flow graph is built, which is part of the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler in OPcache. Since JIT is a component of the OPcache extension, this further ties the issue to that area.

The label ""extension"" is appropriate because the problem and its solution are within an extension (OPcache) rather than PHP's core runtime or another component. There's no indication this affects multiple extensions or is a general bug outside any specific extension.

Therefore, after considering all parts, the label accurately reflects the issue.
</think>

rust-lang/rust,128799,documentation,Rustdoc should not render associated items of a negative impl,"```This Rust code snippet defines a struct `Thing` and implements the `!Iterator` trait for it using negative trait bounds, indicating that `Thing` is not an iterator.```

`cargo +nightly doc`

<p align=""center""><img width=""400"" src=""<URL>

I would prefer if only the negative impl signature `impl !Iterator for Thing` were rendered here (and any doc comment on the negative impl). Not even a collapsed-by-default accordion to show the trait's contents. The reader can click the trait's name to see what is in it if they need.

Having associated items of a negative impl rendered is inconvenient because something like <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd> for ""fn position"" will land the reader deep in the middle of the big impl showing them APIs that their type does _not_ have.

Example of this occurring in standard library documentation: [`impl<'a, I, A: Allocator> !Iterator for &'a Box<[I], A> {}`](<URL>

Mentioning `feature(negative_impls)` tracking issue. <URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""documentation"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, looking at the title: ""Rustdoc should not render associated items of a negative impl"". This clearly indicates that the issue is about how Rust's documentation tool, rustdoc, displays certain implementation details. Negative impls are a feature in Rust, and the problem here is with their rendering in the generated documentation.

The body of the issue provides an example code snippet using negative impls and describes how running `cargo +nightly doc` produces unwanted associated items in the documentation. The user expresses that they only want the negative impl signature to be shown without any expanded sections, as including them can confuse users or make searching within the docs less efficient.

Next, examining the patches provided:

1. **Patch 1** introduces a method `is_negative_trait_impl` which checks if an implementation is negative. This seems to add functionality related to identifying such impls in the code.

2. **Patch 2** modifies how trait information is written. It uses the new method from Patch 1 to conditionally add an exclamation mark before the trait name, indicating a negative impl. This affects how rustdoc outputs the trait signature in the documentation.

3. **Patch 3** changes the rendering logic so that associated items of a negative impl are not displayed. It wraps the loop that processes each trait item with a condition to skip if it's a negative impl.

4. **Patch 4** adds test cases to ensure that negative impls don't show their items in the generated HTML documentation. This confirms that the behavior is consistent and expected after the changes.

All these patches are modifying parts of rustdoc's codebase, specifically how implementations are processed and rendered into HTML. The core issue is about improving or correcting the way documentation is presented for certain Rust features (negative impls).

The label ""documentation"" accurately captures this because the problem revolves around the output and rendering of documentation generated by rustdoc. It's not about a bug in the language itself, runtime behavior, or other aspects, but specifically about how information is displayed to users through the documentation tool.

Therefore, yes, the label reflects the issue report appropriately.

microsoft/vscode,216729,scrolling,Terminal sticky scroll has bad contrast in HC themes,"Top 2 lines, notice no shadow/line on the bottom:

<img width=""578"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-06-20 at 8 58 08 AM"" src=""<URL>

For HC dark it looks like a regular row and there is no hover feedback",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""scrolling"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Terminal sticky scroll has bad contrast in HC themes."" The term ""sticky scroll"" immediately suggests it's related to scrolling behavior in the terminal. Sticky scrolls are those that stay fixed even when the content moves, so this is definitely about scrolling.

Next, the body of the issue includes images showing the problem with the scroll's appearance in high contrast (HC) themes. It mentions a lack of shadow or line at the bottom and no hover feedback for HC dark themes. This indicates the issue is about the visual aspects of the scroll feature when using certain themes.

Now, examining the patches made to resolve this issue:

Patch 1 adds a new variable ""--vscode-terminalStickyScroll-border"" which is related to the border styling of the sticky scroll. This affects how the scroll bar looks, tying back to the contrast and visibility issues mentioned.

Patch 2 modifies the CSS by adding a bottom border using the new variable from Patch 1. This directly addresses the visual feedback problem when hovering over the scroll area in HC themes.

Patch 3 updates color definitions for different themes, specifically setting ""hcDark"" and ""hcLight"" colors for both the background on hover and the new border. It removes the transparent color for HC light, ensuring better contrast.

All these patches are clearly aimed at improving the visual elements of the sticky scroll feature in the terminal, particularly focusing on the borders and backgrounds to enhance contrast and provide proper hover feedback.

The assigned label is ""scrolling."" Since all the changes relate to how the scroll bar appears and functions visually, especially in high-contrast themes, this label seems appropriate. The issue isn't about new functionality but about improving the existing scrolling feature's appearance.

Therefore, the label accurately reflects the problem described and the fixes applied.
</think>

The patches address issues with the terminal's sticky scroll appearance in HC themes, focusing on borders and contrast to improve visual feedback during scrolling interactions.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43706,configuration,Several auto-configurations are creating JMX beans unnecessarily,"We have a few `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotations that check for `""spring.jmx""` with `matchIfMissing = true` (e.g. `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.integration.IntegrationAutoConfiguration.IntegrationJmxConfiguration`).

Since commit ce9626d00fcaf12621278ac0a008813f61cbbff3 `JmxAutoConfiguration` does not have `matchIfMissing`, so I wonder if we should align all our conditions.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by reading through all the information provided.

The title of the issue is ""Several auto-configurations are creating JMX beans unnecessarily."" That suggests that there's an issue with how certain auto-configuration classes are handling JMX beans, leading to their unnecessary creation.

Looking at the body of the issue: it mentions that several `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotations are checking for `""spring.jmx""` with `matchIfMissing = true`. An example given is in `IntegrationJmxConfiguration`. The user also points out that after a specific commit, `JmxAutoConfiguration` doesn't have `matchIfMissing`, and they're wondering if all conditions should be aligned.

So the problem seems to revolve around the conditional annotations used in auto-configurations. These conditionals determine whether certain beans are created based on properties, and with `matchIfMissing = true`, it's checking if the property exists even when it's not set.

Now looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

Patch 1 modifies a line in `IntegrationJmxConfiguration` by removing `matchIfMissing = true` from `@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty`. Similarly, Patch 2 does the same for `DataSourceJmxConfiguration`.

So both patches are adjusting the conditional annotations on auto-configuration classes. The changes remove the `matchIfMissing` parameter, which likely stops unnecessary creation of JMX beans when the property isn't explicitly set.

The label assigned is ""configuration."" Since the issue deals with how configurations (specifically auto-configurations) use certain properties and conditions to determine bean creation, this seems relevant. The patches modify configuration classes, changing their conditional annotations, which directly relates to configuration behavior.

Therefore, the label ""configuration"" accurately captures the essence of the problem and the solution.

spring-projects/spring-boot,41945,forward port,Document when environment variable property mapping applies,Forward port of issue #41877 to 3.3.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to evaluate whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Document when environment variable property mapping applies."" This suggests that the issue is about adding documentation to clarify how environment variables map to properties in the code. So the main goal here seems to be improving documentation regarding environment variable bindings.

Next, the body of the issue says it's a forward port of issue #41877 to the 3.3.x branch. A ""forward port"" typically means taking a fix or feature from one version and applying it to another, usually a newer or different branch. This indicates that whatever was done in issue #41877 needs to be applied now in this current branch.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

In Patch 1, lines are modified around line 955. The changes involve adding a specific sentence about support for binding from environment variables being applied to certain property sources. It adds clarification on where this feature applies, specifically mentioning `systemEnvironment` and any additional sources ending with `-systemEnvironment`.

So the patch is updating documentation by adding a specific detail that explains how environment variable binding works in different contexts. This directly relates to documenting when environment variable property mapping applies, which aligns with the title.

The label assigned is ""forward port."" Since this issue is indeed about taking changes from another issue and applying them to a different branch (as indicated by the body), the label seems correct at first glance because it's a forward port of documentation. However, I should consider if there's another label that might be more accurate.

But wait, what does ""forward port"" mean in this context? It usually refers to moving a fix or feature from an older version to a newer one. Here, the issue is about documenting when environment variable property mapping applies, which is part of the original issue (#41877) now being moved. So the action taken here (documenting) was part of that forward port.

The patch doesn't add new functionality but clarifies existing behavior through documentation. So the primary purpose of this issue is to ensure that the documentation in the 3.3.x branch reflects when environment variable mapping applies, which was previously addressed in another version.

Therefore, applying a change from one branch to another (forward porting) is exactly what's happening here. The label ""forward port"" captures that action accurately because it's about moving changes between branches rather than introducing new features or bug fixes within the same branch.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this issue report as it involves taking documentation changes from one version and applying them to another branch.

sveltejs/svelte,12112,compatibility,Rename `legacy.componentApi` to `compatibility.classComponent`,"### Describe the problem

We replaced the Svelte 4 `legacy` option (which added IE compatibility at the cost of bloatier output) with a completely different `legacy` option. Per #12100, this is a bit confusing.

### Describe the proposed solution

Rename `legacy.componentApi` to `compatibility.classComponent` (but keep `classComponent` deprecated).

I'm not 100% sure this is the right name, since it also affects SSR output (which was never a class, just an object), so am open to alternatives.

### Importance

nice to have",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""compatibility"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the title: ""Rename `legacy.componentApi` to `compatibility.classComponent`"". It suggests renaming a configuration option related to legacy features. The word ""compatibility"" is present here, which might indicate that the change is about maintaining compatibility with previous versions or behaviors.

In the body of the issue, the user describes replacing an old `legacy` option with a new one and mentions confusion due to this change. They propose renaming `legacy.componentApi` to `compatibility.classComponent`, but they're unsure if it's the best name because it affects SSR output as well. The proposed solution is about improving clarity around compatibility settings.

Now, examining the patches provided:

- Patch 1 introduces a breaking change renaming `legacy.componentApi` to `compatibility.componentApi`.
- Patches 2 through 14 modify various files, replacing references from `legacy.componentApi` to `compatibility.componentApi` and updating default values. For example, in some files, they change the option's structure from a boolean to a number (4 or 5), indicating version-specific compatibility settings.
- Several patches update error messages to refer to `compatibility.componentApi` instead of `legacy.componentApi`, which affects user-facing information about compatibility options.

All these changes are centered around renaming and restructuring configuration options related to backward compatibility. The main focus is on ensuring that users can maintain compatibility with older Svelte versions or behaviors by adjusting these settings, thus preventing breaking changes from affecting their existing code.

The label ""compatibility"" seems appropriate because the issue is about making the configuration more intuitive for users dealing with version transitions and ensuring their code remains compatible without unnecessary disruptions.

Alright, let's break down whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given issue report.

First, looking at the title of the issue: it mentions an error from torch._dynamo.exc.Unsupported related to a non-Tensor bool return. This indicates that during runtime, when the code is executed, an exception was raised because an operation expected a Tensor but got a boolean instead.

The body describes encountering this error while running a test and provides environment details, including PyTorch version and system info. The presence of an error log points to a problem occurring during execution, not at compile time or in the build process.

Now, examining the patches applied. Patch 1 adds a test for tensor_is_complex which checks if a Tensor is complex. This suggests that the issue was related to improper handling of complex types in PyTorch functions. Patch 2 introduces method_is_complex in the dtype handling, ensuring that the correct boolean value is returned when checking if a data type is complex.

These patches imply that the original problem stemmed from incorrect or missing checks for complex data types, leading to runtime exceptions when operations were performed on Tensors of unexpected types. The error occurred during the execution of code that used these functions, hence qualifying it as a runtime issue.

Therefore, the label ""runtime error"" fits because the issue manifests while the program is running and isn't related to compilation or build errors.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue since the problem occurs during execution when an unexpected boolean is returned instead of a Tensor. The patches address this by adding proper type checks.

Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""bug"" accurately reflects this issue report. I'm a bit new to evaluating these things, so I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""[Bug Report][3.6.15] VNumberInput - when typing using keyboard @update:model-value is not triggerred, counter not visible when clicking"". The word ""bug"" is right there in the title, so that's a hint. It seems like the user is reporting an unintended behavior.

Next, I'll read through the body of the issue. The environment section lists Vuetify and Vue versions, which helps identify if it's a known issue with those versions. Then, under ""Steps to reproduce,"" the user explains that when typing numbers into VNumberInput using the keyboard, the @update:model-value isn't triggered immediately, unlike in VTextField. They also mention that the counter isn't visible when clicking the up/down buttons, which they find inconsistent.

In the ""Expected Behavior"" section, the user wants the model to update instantly, similar to VTextField, so validators and counters work right away. But the actual behavior is that the update happens only after leaving the field, which is not what's expected.

Looking at the patches provided: Patch 1 modifies how the model value is set in VNumberInput. It adds checks for valid numbers within min and max ranges before updating the model. This suggests that previously, the component wasn't correctly handling these validations on input, leading to delayed updates. 

Patch 2 adds a test case where typing '10' into the input should update the model value immediately. Before this patch, it seems the model didn't update until focus was lost, which aligns with the bug report.

So putting it all together: The issue is about unexpected behavior in VNumberInput not updating the model immediately and counters not showing up as expected. Both of these are functional issues that needed code fixes to resolve, which were provided. Therefore, labeling this as a ""bug"" makes sense because it's an unintended behavior that was fixed with specific patches.

Alright, I need to determine if the label ""configuration"" accurately reflects the given issue report and the changes made in the provided patches.

First, looking at the issue title: it's about improving the UI/UX for plugin management. The body describes several goals like simplifying the interface, making installed plugins more visible, and enhancing search functionality.

Now, examining the patches:

1. **Patch 12** introduces a new `SectionLabel` component to display section headers conditionally based on visibility. This affects how sections are presented in the UI.
2. **Patch 11** modifies the `PluginSearch` component by changing the search input's placeholder and adding a clear button. It also replaces the results count text with the new `SectionLabel`.
3. **Patch 10** restructures the UI by moving the search section outside of an accordion group, adds a `SectionLabel`, and adjusts styling for better spacing.
4. **Patch 9** changes the structure of accordions to separate installed plugins from search, improving navigation.
5. **Patch 8** updates the placeholder text in the search bar to make it more user-friendly.
6. **Patches 7 and 6** modify how plugin items are displayed when they're installed or updated, enhancing visual cues for users.

The changes primarily focus on UI elements like labels, buttons, sections, and overall layout. They aim to make the interface cleaner and more intuitive. While some might relate to functionality (like search), the main emphasis is on presentation and user interaction.

Considering these points, the label ""configuration"" doesn't seem accurate because configuration typically refers to settings or options that users can adjust, not UI improvements. The patches are about enhancing the user experience rather than adding or modifying settings.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 0 as the label doesn't fit.

The issue report and patches focus on improving the user interface and user experience rather than configuration settings. Thus, the label ""configuration"" is inaccurate.

Posting as an issue since the PR is already merged so it doesn't get lost",0,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out whether the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""regression in correctness of handling typeinf avoidance."" So, it's about a regression, meaning something that used to work but now doesn't. The problem is related to the correctness of handling type inference avoidance. Type inference is a part of the compiler, so issues here could affect how code is compiled or run.

Moving on to the body. The user mentions that certain values in the CodeInstance constructor are set incorrectly. This leads to compile corruption, like issue #51872, and fails to handle cases where retrieve_code_info returns nothing instead of CodeInfo. They suggest reverting a helper function or adding an alternative way to call the constructor.

Now, looking at the patches provided. The first patch adds a new finish! function with several lines of code. It seems to be handling the construction of CodeInstance more carefully, including error checking when retrieve_code_info might fail. The second patch modifies some warning messages, which indicates that there were cases where code wasn't being generated properly, leading to runtime issues. 

Patch three introduces a new function jl_get_ci_equiv, which looks for equivalent code instances with specific properties. This could be related to avoiding incorrect compilations or ensuring the right code is used, preventing runtime errors.

In patch four, an old function is removed and replaced with a call to jl_get_ci_equiv. The fifth patch updates some exports, likely making the new function accessible elsewhere in the codebase.

Putting this together, the issue seems to be about fixing incorrect behavior during type inference, which was causing compile-time issues or potential runtime problems if invalid code was generated. The patches aim to correct how CodeInstance is handled to prevent such corruptions and ensure proper error handling when code info isn't retrieved as expected.

The label ""runtime error"" suggests that the issue causes errors when the program is running. However, the problem described here seems more related to compile-time correctness—ensuring that the generated code doesn't corrupt or produce incorrect results during execution. While runtime errors could occur if the compiled code is faulty, the root cause is in the compiler's handling of type inference.

So, while there might be runtime implications, the primary issue is about compiler correctness.

I honestly cannot tell if this is complaint with the [specification](<URL>

> This document MAY include the top-level fields dependencies and requires-python, and MAY optionally include a [tool] table.

",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue report. Let's start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title says that `dependencies` cannot be missing when `requires-python` is present in inline script metadata. The user provided a Python script with a shebang and some metadata comments. They ran `uv run script.py` and got an error about a missing `dependencies` field, causing a TOML parse error.

Looking at the body, the user references the PEP 723 specification, which allows optional inclusion of both `dependencies` and `requires-python`. So if only `requires-python` is present without `dependencies`, it should still be valid. The error suggests that the tool (probably `uv`) is incorrectly requiring `dependencies` to exist when `requires-python` is there.

Now, checking the patches provided:

1. **Patch 1** changes the `dependencies` field in a struct from a `Vec` to an `Option<Vec>`, making it optional. This aligns with the spec, allowing scripts without dependencies but with a Python requirement.

2. **Patch 2** modifies how the environment is set up when running the script. It checks if `metadata.dependencies` is present and proceeds accordingly. If there are no dependencies, it creates an isolated environment instead of requiring them.

3. **Patch 3** updates test cases to reflect these changes. The new test includes a script without `dependencies`, which should pass now that the code handles optional dependencies correctly.

These patches indicate that the issue was due to a bug in how `uv` handled PEP 723 metadata, specifically not allowing `dependencies` to be missing when they should have been optional. The fixes correct this behavior by making `dependencies` truly optional and adjusting the environment setup accordingly.

So, the label ""bug"" is accurate because it describes an incorrect behavior in the code that was fixed with these patches.
</think>

The issue report correctly identifies a bug where the tool improperly required a mandatory field when it should have been optional according to the specification. The provided patches fix this by making `dependencies` optional and adjusting related functionality.

php/php-src,16137,reporting,Built-in webserver not passing header correctly,"### Description

E.g. the ´Forwarded` header might appear more then once, NGinx and Apache correctly merge them into a comma separated list.
But the built-in server does not and just passes the first header set.

To test:

```This PHP code snippet outputs the value of the `HTTP_FORWARDED` server variable using `var_dump`.```

Run with:
```This command starts a PHP development server on `localhost` port `8000`.```

Test with curl:
```The shell script uses `curl` to send an HTTP GET request to `localhost:8000`. It includes two custom headers: `Forwarded: for=127.0.0.1` and `Forwarded: for=unknown`. The server responds with a `200 OK` status, and the response includes the `Forwarded` header set to `for=127.0.0.1`.```

Expected output:
`for=127.0.0.1,for=unknown`

### PHP Version

8.3.11

### Operating System

openSUSE Tumbleweek",0,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out whether the label ""reporting"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report.

First, I'll read through the issue description. The title says that the built-in webserver isn't passing headers correctly. Specifically, when there are multiple 'Forwarded' headers, they should be merged into a comma-separated list, but the built-in server only takes the first one.

Looking at the body, the user provided a test case using PHP's built-in server and curl commands to demonstrate the issue. They showed that when two Forwarded headers are sent, only the first is captured. The expected output should combine both values with a comma.

Now, checking the patches. There are three patches here. Patch 1 mentions fixing a bug related to duplicate HTTP headers in the CLI. Patches 2 and 3 show changes in how headers are handled. In Patch 2, it looks like they're modifying the server code to combine header values, except for Set-Cookie which is special. They're appending new values with "", "" so that multiple headers get merged. The test case in Patch 3 checks if both X-Forwarded-For headers are correctly captured as a combined string.

So the issue was about a bug in how headers were handled by the built-in server, and the patches fix this by properly combining duplicate headers into one comma-separated value.

The label assigned is ""reporting."" But I'm trying to think if that's the right category. Labels like ""bug,"" ""enhancement,"" or maybe ""server"" would seem more appropriate here because it's about a specific functionality issue with the server not handling headers correctly. The term ""reporting"" doesn't quite fit as it usually refers to issues related to generating reports or logging, which isn't what this problem is about.

Therefore, I don't think the label accurately reflects the issue. It should be something that indicates it's a bug fix related to header handling in the built-in web server.
</think>

The label ""reporting"" doesn't accurately reflect the nature of the issue, which is a bug related to how headers are handled by the built-in server. More appropriate labels would indicate this is a bug or specific to server functionality.

TBH I am not really sure if the 1.22 behavior was correct, so not necessarily against the change. We detected this in unit tests only.",1,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""behavior"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the title: ""net/netip: undocumented breaking change in reflect.DeepEquals"". This suggests there was a significant change in behavior that wasn't documented, which affected how `reflect.DeepEqual` works with `netip.Addr` types.

The body of the issue provides more context. The user observed different outputs between Go 1.22 and 1.23 when comparing IPv4 addresses and their IPv6-mapped counterparts using `reflect.DeepEqual()`. They expected consistent behavior across releases or proper documentation if a change was intentional. This indicates that the issue is about an unexpected alteration in how the function behaves, which is a behavioral change.

Now looking at the patches made. The patch explains that prior to Go 1.23, `reflect.DeepEqual` incorrectly returned true when comparing IPv4 and their mapped IPv6 addresses as `netip.Addr`. After the fix, all comparison methods (`==`, `Compare`, `DeepEqual`) give consistent results. This clearly shows a change in behavior was addressed, making the system more consistent.

The label ""behavior"" seems to fit because the issue revolves around an unintended or undocumented change in how functions behave across different versions of Go. It's not about performance, bugs in other areas, or new features, but specifically about altering existing behaviors and ensuring consistency.

",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""syntax"" correctly reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patches applied.

First, looking at the issue's title: ""missing diagnostic"". This suggests that when certain code was run, an error or warning message (diagnostic) wasn't produced as expected. The user provided a Rust code snippet they tried, expecting some output but got nothing instead.

In the body, the user provided this code:
```rust
fn constant<const C: usize>() -> impl use< Sized {}
```
They mentioned that when they ran it, nothing happened—no error or message. They were using a nightly version of Rust, so it's likely related to how the compiler handles certain syntax or errors.

Now, looking at the patches applied to fix this issue:

Patch 1 modifies the parser by setting `self.last_unexpected_token_span` to `None;`. This seems like it's handling an error recovery situation, possibly preventing a fatal error without proper diagnostics. So, the code change is in how the parser handles unexpected tokens and recovers from them.

Patch 2 adds a test case where the function signature has an unexpected `{`, which should trigger specific error messages about expecting `,` or `>`. The test expects two errors: one for an unexpected token and another for a missing item. This indicates that prior to the patch, these errors weren't being reported correctly, leading to a ""missing diagnostic"".

Patch 3 shows the expected error outputs after applying the fix. It includes clear messages pointing out where the issues are in the code. Before this fix, the compiler didn't produce these diagnostics, hence the original problem.

Putting it all together: The issue was that when certain syntax errors occurred, the Rust compiler failed to emit proper error messages (diagnostics). The patches ensure that appropriate errors are generated for such cases. 

The label ""syntax"" is assigned because the problem revolves around how the parser handles syntax errors and generates diagnostics for incorrect code structures. This makes sense since the issue isn't about runtime behavior or performance but about the compiler correctly identifying and reporting syntax-related issues.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40705,ci,Use ubuntu-latest GitHub Actions runner for Linux builds,,1,"<think>
Alright, so I need to determine if the label ""ci"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches applied. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Use ubuntu-latest GitHub Actions runner for Linux builds."" This clearly indicates that the issue is about changing the CI/CD setup to use a different runner. The term ""runner"" here refers to the environment where the GitHub Actions jobs are executed.

Next, the body of the issue is empty, so there's no additional context beyond the title. However, the patches provide all the necessary details. Let me go through each patch:

Patch 1 adds a step to free disk space specifically when the runner OS is Linux. It uses an action from a third-party repository, which suggests it's optimizing the build environment.

Patches 2 through 6 all modify the `runs-on` field in various jobs from `ubuntu22-8-32-OSS` to `ubuntu-latest`. This change is consistent with the title and directly relates to updating the CI configuration. Each of these changes affects different jobs like build, deploy, system tests, etc., indicating a comprehensive update across the repository's CI setup.

The label in question is ""ci,"" which stands for Continuous Integration. All the patches involve modifications to GitHub Actions workflows, which are part of CI/CD pipelines. Changing runners and optimizing steps are typical CI configuration tasks aimed at improving build reliability and efficiency.

Since all the changes are about updating the runner versions and adding steps to manage resources (like freeing disk space), they fall under the umbrella of CI improvements. Therefore, the ""ci"" label accurately reflects the nature of this issue.

Okay, let me try to figure out whether the label 'enhancement' is accurate for this GitHub issue. 

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""upgrade go1.23.3"". That clearly indicates that the issue is about upgrading the Go version from 1.23.2 to 1.23.3. So it's a version update.

Now, reading the body of the issue, it's a notification about the release of new minor versions, 1.23.3 and 1.22.9. It provides links to the release notes and download pages. The message is informative, telling users how to update their Go installations. This seems more like an announcement rather than a feature request or enhancement.

Looking at the patches applied: all three patches are changing the version number from 1.23.2 to 1.23.3 in different places. Patch 1 updates the version variable in a function, Patch 2 changes the ARG in a Dockerfile, and Patch 3 updates an ENV variable. These are straightforward version upgrades without adding new functionality or features.

The term 'enhancement' usually refers to improvements or new features added to the codebase. However, upgrading a dependency version, especially a minor one like from .2 to .3, is typically considered a maintenance task rather than an enhancement. It's more about keeping dependencies up-to-date for stability or security rather than introducing new functionality.

Therefore, labeling this issue as 'enhancement' might be incorrect. It should probably be labeled under something like 'maintenance', 'upgrade', or 'dependency update'. So the label doesn't accurately reflect the nature of the issue.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down each part.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Tomcat 10.1.33"". The word ""upgrade"" is right there in the title, which suggests that this issue is about updating something to a newer version. That seems pretty straightforward.

Next, the body of the issue just says ""Upgrade to [Tomcat 10.1.33](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.1-doc/changelog.html)."" Again, it's explicitly mentioning an upgrade, so that reinforces the idea that this is about updating Tomcat.

Now, looking at the patches provided. Patch 1 shows a change from version 10.1.31 to 10.1.33 in the variable tomcatVersion. That clearly indicates that they're increasing the version number, which is exactly what an upgrade entails.

So putting it all together: the title, body, and patch all point towards this issue being about upgrading Tomcat to a newer version. The label ""upgrade"" seems to perfectly capture the essence of what's happening here. There doesn't seem to be any other aspect or type of change involved beyond just updating the version.

I don't see any reason why the label wouldn't fit. It’s directly related and accurately describes the action taken in the issue.

The label ""upgrade"" is appropriate because all aspects of the issue—title, body, and patches—indicate an update to Tomcat 10.1.33.

### Related Issues
- The [ICE location](<URL> in closed issue #121664 is same as the [current ICE location](<URL>",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""compiler"" is accurate for this GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""ICE: `no entry found for key`"". ICE stands for Internal Compiler Error, which immediately tells me that something went wrong within the Rust compiler itself. So right away, I know this is a problem with the compiler, not something else like a library or documentation.

Next, the body of the issue provides more details. The user included code snippets and error outputs. The code has a trait `Foo` with an associated type and a function `demo()` that returns `impl Foo`. There's also a where clause checking if `String: Copy`, which isn't valid because `String` doesn't implement `Copy`. 

The error output shows two main issues: a missing lifetime specifier and the fact that `String` doesn't implement `Copy`. But more importantly, there's an ICE with a backtrace. The backtrace mentions a panic in the Rust compiler, specifically in the `hir/mod.rs` file at line 178. This indicates that during compilation, the compiler encountered an unexpected situation it couldn't handle gracefully, leading to a crash instead of a proper error message.

The patches provided also shed light on this. Patch 1 seems to adjust how the code is handled, perhaps avoiding the panic by modifying how parent HIR elements are accessed. Patch 2 adds more detailed errors related to the `String: Copy` bound but doesn't fix the ICE directly; it just improves error reporting.

Looking at the labels assigned, only ""compiler"" was used. Since the issue revolves around the compiler crashing with an internal error when processing certain code, this label fits perfectly. There's no indication that this is a bug in the standard library or another component—it's clearly about the compiler's handling of specific Rust code structures.

I don't see any other labels like ""library"" or ""documentation"" being appropriate here because the problem is within the compiler's processing. Therefore, the label ""compiler"" accurately reflects the nature of this issue.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""feature request"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. Let me start by understanding what the issue is about.

The title says: ""cmd/go: go build -asan may mis-parse gcc compiler version in a non-English environment."" From that, it looks like there's an issue when using 'go build' with the '-asan' flag, specifically related to how the Go toolchain parses the GCC compiler version. The problem seems to occur when the system isn't set to English because the output of 'gcc -v' is in another language.

Looking at the body, the user explains that they're using Go 1.21.0 on Linux and ran into an error where '-asan' isn't supported with GCC 0.0. They provided their environment variables and the output of 'go env', which shows that CGO is enabled (CGO_ENABLED='1') and the compiler is set to 'gcc'.

When they tried to build, the system couldn't parse the GCC version correctly because the output wasn't in English. The user pointed out that the regular expression used to extract the version number didn't match the non-English output from 'gcc -v'. They suggested changing the regex to fix this issue.

The patches provided show changes in how the Go toolchain executes the compiler commands. Specifically, they set the environment variable LANG=C before running 'gcc --version' and 'gcc -v', ensuring that the output is in English, making it easier for the existing regex to parse correctly. This approach avoids changing the regex itself and instead standardizes the output.

Now, considering the labels: the issue was labeled as a ""feature request."" But looking at the problem, this seems more like a bug fix rather than a new feature. The user encountered an error when using existing functionality ('-asan') under certain conditions (non-English environment). They provided a solution to make the parsing robust against such conditions.

Feature requests typically ask for new functionalities or enhancements, not fixes for existing issues. This issue is about correcting behavior that's not working as intended, so it should be labeled as a bug rather than a feature request.

The patches confirm this by adjusting how environment variables are set to ensure consistent output, which is a bug fix. Therefore, the label ""feature request"" doesn't accurately reflect the nature of this issue.

We should document this or add an explicit check for yanked versions even when resolving from the lockfile.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""package management"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break down the information provided.

The issue title is ""Resolve from lockfile cannot detect yanked versions."" Yanked versions refer to packages that have been removed from a registry, often because they're broken or insecure. The body of the issue explains that when resolving dependencies from a lockfile, the system doesn't query the registry and thus can't detect these yanked versions. It suggests documenting this behavior or adding an explicit check.

Looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 adds a note in the help documentation stating that when installing from a lockfile, warnings for yanked package versions won't be provided. Similarly, Patch 2 adds the same note but in a different part of the documentation.

These changes are about how the tool handles dependency resolution, specifically regarding yanked packages and the behavior when using a lockfile. The core issue is about managing dependencies and ensuring that the system correctly identifies and handles problematic package versions.

The label ""package management"" seems appropriate because it directly relates to how dependencies are managed, including resolving issues with specific package versions and their states (like being yanked). The patches address documentation around this behavior, which falls under package management processes.

Okay, I need to determine if the label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part of the issue says.

The title is: ""RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript - Unhandled null exception: 'parentOffsetMap' is null"". This immediately tells me that there's an unhandled exception occurring when running a specific script in Ghidra.

Looking at the body, the user provided a detailed stack trace. The main error is a NullPointerException because ""parentOffsetMap"" is null. The exception occurs during the execution of the RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript script after running auto-analysis. This indicates that while the script was executing, it encountered an unexpected null value which wasn't handled properly.

In the steps to reproduce, the user outlines that running the script leads to this error, which disrupts the expected behavior of the script. The patches provided show that in the method getSingleVirtualParentOffset, a check was added to see if parentOffsetMap is null before attempting to retrieve a value from it. This change prevents the NullPointerException by returning null instead of causing an exception.

Now, considering the label ""runtime error"". A runtime error refers to errors that occur during the execution of a program, as opposed to compile-time errors. In this case, the issue clearly arises when the script is run, leading to a crash due to an unhandled null value. Therefore, labeling it as a runtime error makes sense because the problem manifests during execution.

The patches address this by adding a null check, which prevents the exception and allows the program to handle the scenario gracefully. This further supports that the issue was indeed a runtime error caused by not handling a possible null value.

I don't see any indications that this is a different type of issue like a build error or a logical bug unrelated to exceptions during execution. The core problem is an unhandled exception at runtime, so the label fits.
</think>

The label ""runtime error"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves an unhandled NullPointerException occurring during script execution.

The title says it's an ""Invalid URL in middleware rewrite from edge runtime server action."" That sounds like something is going wrong when using a middleware rewrite in a server action running on the Edge runtime, causing an invalid URL error.

Looking at the body, the user provided steps to reproduce, which involve submitting a form and getting a TypeError due to an invalid URL. They also mentioned that this happens specifically in the Edge runtime, not Node.js. The stack trace points to errors in NextURL creation, which suggests something is wrong with how URLs are being handled.

In their environment info, they're using Next.js version 14.1.1-canary.17, and there's a note about a newer canary version available. They ran git bisect and found the issue started after commit #60798. That makes me think this is a regression introduced by that change, which would typically be considered a bug.

Now looking at the patches provided to fix the issue:

Patch 1 modifies the adapter function in Next.js. It adds a condition to check if it's not Edge rendering before processing the rewrite. This suggests that without this check, the code was causing issues specifically on Edge, hence why the error occurred there.

Patches 2 through 9 are test additions and some server action files, which seem to set up the environment for testing the fix. These don't directly indicate whether it's a bug or feature but show that they're ensuring the issue is resolved across different runtimes.

Considering all this, the problem arises from a change in Next.js (commit #60798) that introduced an invalid URL error only in Edge runtime when using middleware rewrites. The fact that it's a regression and the provided fix modifies the code to prevent the error under certain conditions supports that this is indeed a bug rather than a feature request or something else.

So, yes, labeling this as a ""bug"" seems accurate because it's an unintended behavior introduced by a code change.

microsoft/terminal,17457,bug,Duplicate Titlebar when System Theme Changes,"### Windows Terminal version

1.20.11381.0

### Windows build number

10.0.19045.0

### Other Software

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a new Windows Terminal window
2. Close the window
3. Change the Windows application theme (in either direction)
4. Open a new Windows Terminal window again
5. See the duplicated title bar
![7lb27k8HVO](<URL>


### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Actual Behavior

## How to trigger this
When the Windows application theme changes (light<->dark), **and a quake mode WT instance is running in the background**, upon opening a new instance of Windows Terminal, two titlebars are present.

This happens if and only if a WT window (other than the quake window) was opened **and closed** before the theme change, and a new WT window is opened after the theme change.

If the theme change happens whilst a WT window is open, the application colours change correctly and the titlebar isn't duplicated for the existing window. However, opening a new WT window will show the extra titlebar.

## Fixing this through the titlebar
Interacting with either titlebar (hitting the minimize or maximize buttons) makes the extra titlebar disappear and retains only the WT titlebar. However, hitting either close button, and then opening a new WT window, the extra titlebar is still present.

## Fixing this through the setting
Toggling the `Appearance > Hide the titlebar` setting from On to Off, and closing the affected window, when opening a new WT window, the two titlebars are still present but weirdly overlapping:
![image](<URL>
Then, toggling the aforementioned setting from Off back to On, and closing the affected window, when opening a new WT window the extra titlebar is not present.

## When does it happen again
Once the duplicate titlebar disappears, it won't appear again until another theme change.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the label ""bug"" accurately reflects the given issue report based on the provided information. Let's start by looking at the details.

First, the title of the issue is ""Fix tests for RemoteProcessSurface."" That suggests that there might be failing tests related to this class. Tests failing often indicate bugs because they're not passing as expected, which usually means something is wrong with the code.

Looking through the patches provided, I see several changes in test configurations and build setups. For example, in patch 153, a parameter set in a PowerShell script is modified, removing 'winconpty' from the ValidateSet. In patch 154, a line in a batch script is removed, which was including Remoting.Unit.Tests.dll. Similarly, patch 155 removes a test entry for unitRemoting.

These changes seem to be removing references to certain tests or configurations related to remoting. It's possible that these tests were failing or causing issues, so they're being excluded or fixed. The fact that multiple patches are adjusting how tests are run and which ones are included implies there was an issue with the testing setup or the code that the tests were checking.

The main patch (numbered 153) modifies a function's parameter validation to exclude 'winconpty', which might be related to the RemoteProcessSurface. This could mean that prior to this change, including 'winconpty' was causing test failures, so it's being removed to fix the issue.

Additionally, in patch 151 and others, there are changes to precompiled headers or includes, which sometimes are done to resolve build issues or bugs in the codebase.

Given all these patches, especially those removing problematic tests and adjusting configurations, it seems like the original problem was indeed a bug that needed fixing. The label ""bug"" accurately captures this situation because the issue was about resolving test failures or code issues related to RemoteProcessSurface.
</think>

The changes made address test failures and configurations, indicating that the original issue was a bug. Therefore, the label is accurate.

vim/vim,15526,behavior,Completion is performed upon pressing enter even though nothing has been selected,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Write the following into a txt file
```The code snippet appears to be a Vim command followed by some text. It sets options for Vim and then defines two mappings: `cot` maps to `fuzzy`, `menuone`, `noselect`, and `noinsert`. `Text` and `ToText` seem to be additional mappings without specified actions.```
2. Edit the file with `vim --clean`, then start a newline at the bottom and insert `Te`
```The code snippet appears to be a combination of Vim editor settings and text input. The Vim settings are `vim:cot=fuzzy,menuone,noselect,noinsert`, and the text input is `Text`, `ToText`, `Te|`.```
3. Still in insert mode, press `<C-N>`. A menu should popup with option `Text` and `ToText` but neither should be selected.
4. Type `x`. Popup menu should be visible still with no entry selected.
5. Press `<CR>`. This would produce a newline and `ToText` should be completed nevertheless.

### Expected behaviour

Completion should not be done as no entry has been selected, leaving `Tex` on the last line.

### Environment

### Logs and stack traces

_No response_",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate whether the label ""behavior"" is accurate for the given GitHub issue. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: ""Completion is performed upon pressing enter even though nothing has been selected."" This suggests that the issue is about how Vim's completion behaves when no option is selected but Enter is pressed. It's about an unintended action happening, which relates to behavior.

Next, the body of the issue describes steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and the environment. The key point here is that pressing Enter completes with ""ToText"" even though nothing was selected. This is a clear description of unexpected behavior in the software—specifically how the completion function behaves under certain conditions.

Now, looking at the patches provided:

Patch 1 modifies `ins_compl_build_pum(void)` by adding a condition to check if `compl_no_select` is false before setting `compl_shown_match`. This change affects when the completion system selects an item, directly impacting its behavior.

Patch 2 adds a test case that simulates the scenario described in the issue. It sets up specific options and feeds keys to ensure that after pressing Enter without selecting anything, the expected text ""Tex"" remains instead of completing to ""ToText"". This test checks for correct behavior under these conditions.

Patch 3 seems to be adding a new patch number (684) to the list of included patches, which is more about version control and not directly about functionality. However, it's part of resolving the issue, indicating that it's related to behavior changes.

All these patches are addressing how Vim's completion feature behaves when certain options like 'noselect' are set. They modify the conditions under which an item is considered selected or not, ensuring that pressing Enter without a selection doesn't trigger unintended completion.

The label ""behavior"" is appropriate because it directly relates to how the software acts in specific scenarios. The issue isn't about a bug in the sense of crashing or incorrect output but rather about the program's behavior deviating from expected norms when certain actions are taken.

spring-projects/spring-framework,32982,metadata,Remove TestOverrideMetadata and adapt tests to use a simple implementation,"The root package of bean override (`org.springframework.test.context.bean.override`)  does not provide a simple implementation so some tests are relying on `ExampleBeanOverrideAnnotation`. This ""test"" implementation is doing a lot of things internally and I am not sure it should.

Its usage is now restricted to `BeanOverrideBeanFactoryPostProcessorTests` which could use something a bit more simpler certainly.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""metadata"" accurately reflects this issue report based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there's a series of patches made to a repository. The main focus seems to be on classes and annotations related to bean overrides in Spring Test Context. From the code changes, it looks like they're refactoring how metadata is handled for overriding beans during testing.

The issue report includes several patches that remove or modify various classes and annotations, such as ExampleBeanOverrideAnnotation, ExampleBeanOverrideProcessor, TestOverrideMetadata, etc. These classes seem to be part of a custom solution for handling bean overrides with specific annotations and processors.

In the code changes, I notice that there's a shift towards using a new annotation called TestBeanOverrideMetaAnnotation, which is annotated with ExampleBeanOverrideAnnotation. This suggests they might be consolidating or changing how metadata about bean overrides is managed.

The main change seems to be moving away from custom annotations and processors (like ExampleBeanOverrideProcessor) and towards a more streamlined approach, possibly using built-in Spring features or new internal classes. For example, the TestOverrideMetadata class is being removed, which was responsible for handling method lookups and override strategies.

Looking at the test cases in the initial code snippets, they're checking how the framework handles duplicate bean overrides by triggering specific conditions. This indicates that metadata about beans (like names, methods, etc.) is crucial for correctly managing these overrides without conflicts.

The removal of several classes and annotations implies that the project is simplifying its approach to handling bean override metadata. Instead of maintaining custom processors and metadata classes, they might be relying more on standard Spring mechanisms or centralizing the metadata management.

Considering all this, the label ""metadata"" seems appropriate because the changes are primarily about how the framework manages and processes metadata related to bean overrides. The patches modify how annotations are handled, how metadata is stored and looked up, and how duplicates are detected—all of which pertain to metadata management.
</think>

The label ""metadata"" accurately reflects this issue report as it involves changes to how bean override metadata is managed in the framework.

![image](<URL>


cc @albanD",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""debugging"" is accurate for this GitHub issue.

First, I'll look at the title of the issue: ""Better repr for opoverload._schema, opoverload._schema.arguments, etc."" So, it's about improving the string representation (repr) of certain classes. When I see ""repr"", that usually relates to how objects are represented as strings, which is useful for debugging because it helps developers understand the state of an object quickly.

Next, the body of the issue includes a screenshot showing some debugging output, which seems to be difficult to read or interpret. The user mentions it's hard to debug these, which implies that the current repr isn't providing clear information, making the debugging process challenging. They also cc someone, probably another developer who might help with this.

Now, looking at the patches provided: they added a __repr__ method for FunctionSchema and Argument classes using a lambda that streams self into a stringstream. This means they're overriding the default repr to provide a more meaningful string representation of these objects. The purpose here is to make debugging easier because developers can now see a clear and readable representation when inspecting these objects during debugging.

Putting it all together: the issue was about improving the repr for better readability, which directly impacts the ease of debugging. The patches specifically address this by enhancing the __repr__ methods, making the label ""debugging"" appropriate since the main goal is to aid in diagnosing issues more effectively.
</think>

The label accurately reflects the issue as it aims to improve object representation for easier debugging.

### Problem / Steps to reproduce

I set fzf default options to ignore symlinks, yet `**` shell completion doesn't respect this setting, because walker overwrites it depending on the command in question, which might expect file paths or folder paths as arguments, respectively. This is the same issue as #3778 which introduced `FZF_COMPLETION_PATH_OPTS` and `FZF_COMPLETION_DIR_OPTS`, but I only learned about those env vars after finding the issue here on GitHub. They're not mentioned in any docs or man page.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""completion"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let me start by understanding what each part says.

The title of the issue is about missing documentation for two specific environment variables: FZF_COMPLETION_PATH_OPTS and FZF_COMPLETION_DIR_OPTS. That immediately tells me that the problem is related to how fzf handles completion, specifically path and directory options in shell completions.

Looking at the body, the user mentions setting default options but finding that the shell completion doesn't respect them because of how the walker behaves differently for files vs directories. They reference another issue (#3778) which introduced these variables, but they weren't documented anywhere. So, the main problem is the lack of documentation for these environment variables in the man page or elsewhere.

Now, looking at the patches that resolved this issue:

Patch 1 adds entries to the changelog about walker improvements and bug fixes in fish scripts. It also mentions exporting FZF_PREVIEW_* variables. This suggests changes related to how fzf walks through directories and handles environment variables for completion.

Patch 2 modifies sections of documentation. The original section was titled ""Settings,"" but it's renamed to ""Customizing fzf options for completion"" with a new subsection on customizing the source for paths and directories. Additionally, functions _fzf_compgen_path() and _fzf_compgen_dir() are added or modified to use fd for path generation. These changes add documentation about FZF_COMPLETION_PATH_OPTS and FZF_COMPLETION_DIR_OPTS, which were missing before.

The label assigned is ""completion."" Considering that the issue revolves around shell completion in fzf—specifically the lack of documentation for variables affecting how paths and directories are handled during completion—the label seems appropriate. The patches address both adding the necessary documentation and ensuring these environment variables function correctly within the completion context.

So, yes, the label ""completion"" accurately reflects this issue because it's entirely about improving the documentation and functionality related to shell completion in fzf.

Alright, let's try to figure out if the label ""bug"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue. 

First, I'll read through the issue report. The title says that the work state in a dump trace file isn't deterministic and specifically mentions it being 'scheduled' when it should be 'completed'. That sounds like unexpected behavior, which usually points to a bug.

Looking at the body, the user describes a bug where a test fails because the last work's state is 'scheduled' instead of 'completed'. They provide steps to reproduce it by adding a sleep before dumping the trace. The error log shows an assertion failure, which confirms that something isn't working as intended. 

The reason section explains that the issue arises from functions setting the end event to nullptr and how that affects the dump value. This seems like a problem in the code logic, hence a bug.

Now, checking the patches provided. Patch 1 adds a new test method to check if all works are retired and ensures the state is 'completed'. Patch 2 modifies the NCCLTraceBuffer by setting entries as retired and adjusting event pointers. These changes directly address the root cause of the issue, which aligns with fixing a bug rather than adding a feature or other types of issues.

So, considering the problem was unexpected behavior causing test failures, and the patches fix that behavior, labeling it as a ""bug"" makes sense.
</think>

The label ""bug"" accurately reflects the issue report because it describes unexpected behavior causing test failures, which is resolved by specific code fixes.

2. Creates a directory named `all-your-base`, enters it, initializes a Zig project silently, and attempts to build and run it using Wine on a 32-bit Windows target.
3. Captures and displays an error message indicating that the host system cannot execute binaries from the specified target.```

### Expected Behavior

`````The code snippet performs the following steps:
1. Determines the native target triple for the system.
2. Creates a directory named `all-your-base`, navigates into it, initializes a new Zig project silently, and builds/runs the project with Wine targeting x86 Windows GNU.
3. Outputs a humorous message and provides build test instructions.```",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the label ""build"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report based on its title, body, and the patch that resolved it.

First, let's look at the issue details. The title is about building with `-fwine` on a Linux system and getting an error related to the host system being unable to execute target binaries. The body provides steps to reproduce, showing that when trying to build and run using `zig build run -fwine`, there's an error because the host (Linux) can't execute Windows binaries.

The expected behavior is that it should work without errors, as shown by the successful output in their example. Now, looking at the patch provided, it modifies some logic in the code related to checking CPU architecture compatibility when using Wine. It adds more conditions to allow certain architectures to work together under Wine, which probably fixes the issue where the build was failing due to incorrect checks.

Now, considering the label ""build"": the problem occurs during the build process when trying to run a target that's different from the host. The patch is part of the build system, adjusting how it handles cross-compilation or emulation via Wine. So the issue is directly related to building and executing code in a cross-platform context.

I think the label ""build"" fits because the problem arises during the build process and the fix is within the build setup, specifically around target compatibility checks. There's no mention of other areas like testing or documentation, so it seems accurate.

spring-projects/spring-boot,39771,forward port,Remove obsolete JDK 9 check in spring-boot-smoke-test-jersey,Forward port of issue #39750 to 3.2.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue report. Let me break down what I know.

First, the title of the issue is ""Remove obsolete JDK 9 check in spring-boot-smoke-test-jersey"". That makes it clear that the goal was to eliminate some outdated code related to JDK 9. The body mentions it's a forward port of issue #39750 to the 3.2.x branch, which tells me they're taking changes from another version and applying them here.

Looking at the patch provided, I see that lines checking for JavaVersion.current().java9Compatible were removed. So, they took out some conditional logic that was specific to JDK 9 compatibility. Instead of only including jakarta.xml.bind-api when on Java 9 or higher, now it's always included as a runtimeOnly dependency.

The label in question is ""forward port"". Forward porting usually means taking changes from an older version and applying them to a newer one. In this case, the original issue #39750 was likely about removing JDK 9 checks, which were probably made obsolete due to newer Java versions or project requirements.

So, even though the main action here is removing code, the context given in the body explicitly states it's a forward port. The patch itself supports that by moving those changes into the 3.2.x branch. Therefore, the label ""forward port"" accurately captures the nature of this issue because they're applying previous changes to an updated version.

I think the answer is yes, so output should be 1.

golang/go,69284,memory leak,os/exec: resource leak on exec failure,"### Go version

go version go1.23.0 linux/amd64

### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:

```This code snippet defines a series of environment variables used in a Go development environment, including paths, flags, and compiler settings for a Linux system with AMD64 architecture.```


### What did you do?

It seems that when `process.Start` fails, there are some files left open, which after a while leads to a ""too many open files"" error.

Here's a minimal repro:

```This code snippet sets up a test to check how resource limits affect process execution in Go. It temporarily reduces the file descriptor limit, attempts to start a non-existent command multiple times, and verifies that the correct error (`ENOENT`) is returned each time.```


### What did you see happen?

The test fails with:

```The log indicates that a test for executing resources failed. Specifically, it attempted to fork and execute `/bin/nonexistent` but encountered an error due to having too many open files.```

### What did you expect to see?

I expected the test to pass.

Note that the issue occurs also on other `exec` failures, such as permission denied, invalid ELF format, etc.",0,"<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate whether the label ""memory leak"" is accurate for this GitHub issue. The issue is titled ""os/exec: resource leak on exec failure."" So right away, it mentions a resource leak, not specifically memory.

Looking at the body, the user describes that when process.Start() fails, some files are left open, leading to a ""too many open files"" error. They provided a test case where they lower the file descriptor limit and then repeatedly try to execute a nonexistent command, which causes the failure because of too many open files. The problem here is about file descriptors not being closed properly, which is a type of resource leak.

Now, looking at the patches that were applied. Most of them add a function called forkAndExecFailureCleanup. This function seems to be responsible for cleaning up after an exec failure. Specifically, in Patch 6, it checks if there's a PidFD and closes it, then sets it to -1. So the fix is ensuring that certain resources (like file descriptors) are properly released when an error occurs during execution.

The term ""memory leak"" refers specifically to memory not being freed, leading to increased memory usage over time. However, this issue is about resource handles (file descriptors) not being closed, which is a different kind of resource leak. While both are resource management issues, they're distinct types. The patches address closing file descriptors, not freeing memory.

Therefore, labeling this as ""memory leak"" might be incorrect because the problem isn't about memory but about file descriptor leaks. A more accurate label would be something like ""resource leak"" or specifically mentioning file descriptors.
</think>

The issue describes a resource leak related to unclosed file descriptors when `exec` fails. The patches address closing these descriptors, not freeing memory. Thus, ""memory leak"" is inaccurate.

astral-sh/uv,5604,enhancement,Improve documentation for workspaces,"Currently, it's a bit sparse.",1,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the label ""enhancement"" is appropriate for this GitHub issue.

So, the issue's title is ""Improve documentation for workspaces."" The body mentions that the current documentation is a bit sparse. That suggests the user wants more detailed or clearer documentation on how workspaces function.

Looking at the patches provided, they add a lot more content to the documentation. For instance, there are new sections explaining when to use workspaces and when not to, along with examples of common structures and usage. These additions make the documentation more comprehensive, which aligns with the user's request to improve it.

The label ""enhancement"" is typically used for issues that suggest a new feature or improvement to existing functionality. In this case, enhancing the documentation makes the project better by providing users with clearer guidance. It's not a bug fix because nothing was broken; instead, it's about adding more value through better documentation.

So, yes, ""enhancement"" fits here because the changes are improvements rather than fixes or new features.
</think>

The label ""enhancement"" accurately reflects the issue as it involves improving existing documentation, which is an enhancement.

spring-projects/spring-boot,40485,forward port,Runtime hint registration for property binding should not fail when parameter information is unavailable,Forward port of issue #40051 to 3.2.x.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""forward port"" accurately reflects this GitHub issue based on its title, body, and the patches provided.

First, let me look at the title of the issue: ""Runtime hint registration for property binding should not fail when parameter information is unavailable."" This suggests that there's a problem where runtime hints are failing because some parameter info isn't available. The fix probably ensures that the system doesn't crash or throw errors in such cases.

Now, looking at the body of the issue: it says ""Forward port of issue #40051 to 3.2.x."" So this is taking a fix from another issue and applying it to a different branch, specifically the 3.2.x version. That indicates that someone took an existing solution and adapted it for a new context.

Moving on to the patches. The first patch modifies several files. It removes some imports related to parameter name discovery, which were probably part of the problem. Then, in the Processor class, it changes how hints are processed by removing checks that throw exceptions when parameters aren't found. Instead of collecting classes without parameters and then throwing an error if any were found, now it just processes them without failing.

The second patch removes a custom exception class called MissingParametersCompilerArgumentException. This makes sense because if the system isn't supposed to fail anymore when parameter info is missing, that exception isn't needed.

The third patch updates some test cases. They add a new test that checks if registering hints doesn't throw an exception even when parameter names can't be discovered. This ensures that the fix works as intended and doesn't cause issues elsewhere.

Putting it all together: The issue is about preventing failures when certain parameters aren't available, and the solution was to take an existing fix (from issue #40051) and apply it to version 3.2.x. The patches remove error-prone code that caused exceptions and add tests to confirm everything works now.

So, the label ""forward port"" is correct because the main action here was taking a fix from another branch or version and applying it forward to this one. The problem wasn't just about fixing new behavior but ensuring an existing solution works in a different context.
</think>

The label ""forward port"" accurately reflects that the issue involves taking a fix from another context (issue #40051) and applying it to the 3.2.x branch, as evidenced by the patches and body.

spring-projects/spring-boot,43103,dependency upgrade,Upgrade to Jackson Bom 2.18.1,Upgrade to [Jackson Bom 2.18.1](<URL>,1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the label ""dependency upgrade"" accurately reflects the given GitHub issue report. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the title of the issue: ""Upgrade to Jackson Bom 2.18.1"". That clearly indicates that someone wants to update a dependency called Jackson Bom from an older version to 2.18.1. So the main purpose here is to upgrade a library.

Next, the body of the issue provides a link to the release notes for Jackson 2.18.1 on GitHub. This further confirms that the intention is to move to this specific version, which is an upgrade from whatever was being used before.

Now, looking at the patch provided: it's changing the jacksonVersion variable from 2.18.0 to 2.18.1 in a configuration file. This shows that the solution implemented was indeed an increment of the Jackson library version by modifying the build or dependency management file, which is a common way to handle dependencies in projects using tools like Maven or Gradle.

The label assigned is ""dependency upgrade"". Since all the evidence points towards updating a third-party library to a newer version, this label seems appropriate. The issue isn't about bug fixes, new features, or configuration changes—it's specifically about upgrading an existing dependency.

I don't see any conflicting information here. The title, body, and patch all align with the idea of upgrading a dependency. There are no other aspects like refactoring code or adding functionality that might suggest a different label. Therefore, using ""dependency upgrade"" as the label accurately reflects the content of this issue.
</think>

The label ""dependency upgrade"" is appropriate for this issue because it involves updating Jackson Bom to version 2.18.1 through a patch.
