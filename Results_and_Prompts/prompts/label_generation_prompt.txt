You are a project maintainer for the GitHub repository {project}.

The following is the title and body of an issue report that has been submitted to the repository's issue tracking system:

Title: '''{title}'''
Body: '''{body}'''

Your task is to assign reusable labels to this issue report. These labels should:
1. Categorize the type of issue
2. Describe its domain
3. Be reusable across similar issues -- do not use labels that are overly specific or context-bound

Strictly avoid labels that:
- Refer to hardware or platform-specific terms (e.g., 'aarch64', 'sparc32', 'aix')
- Refer to software configuration details (e.g., 'f128-support', 'nightly-build')
- Refer to versions, filenames, or environment setups
- Are status/process-related (e.g., 'needs-triage', 'help-wanted', 'duplicate')

Only output your assigned labels as a valid Python list (e.g., ['label1', 'label2', 'label3', ...]) with no extra explanation.
